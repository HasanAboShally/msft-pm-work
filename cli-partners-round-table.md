# 🌐 Fabric CLI — Partner Roundtable (Research-Focused Agenda)
**Goal:** Understand partner expectations and value for a potential **CLI-in-the-Web** experience inside Microsoft Fabric.  
**Approach:** Broad signal-gathering in the roundtable; deep technical dives in follow‑up 1:1 sessions.

---

## 0. Pre‑Session Quick Calibration (2 min)
Ask in chat or verbally:
- **Which CLI environments do you use most?**  
  (Local machine / Remote VM / Azure Cloud Shell / Containers / Mixed)
- **How often do you use the Fabric CLI today?**
- **What would make this session valuable for you?**

---

## 1. Welcome & Framing (5 min)
Set expectations:
- This is **not** a demo or solution pitch.
- It *is* a structured **partner research session** to shape the future of CLI experiences in Fabric.
- We will collect broad signals now and invite participants to **1:1 follow‑ups** for deeper exploration.

---

## 2. Warm-Up: Who’s in the Room (5 min)
Fast introductions:
- Name  
- Your main CLI stack (PowerShell / Bash / Azure CLI / GitHub CLI / etc.)  
- One example of how you currently use CLI with Fabric (or why not)

---

## 3. Topic 1 — Current CLI Workflows (10 min)
Goal: Establish what “CLI work” means across partners.

**Discussion prompts:**
- What are your **top 3 CLI tasks** you perform frequently?
- Which of these would make sense to run in a **browser‑based environment**?
- Which **must** stay local, and why?
- (If using Fabric CLI today):  
  What’s automated now? What’s still manual but should be automated?

---

## 4. Topic 2 — CLI vs UI Mental Models (10 min)
Goal: Identify reasons people choose CLI over UI (or vice‑versa).

**Prompts:**
- Where does the UI slow you down?
- What “superpowers” does CLI give you that UI cannot?
- Biggest CLI friction today?  
  (Syntax, errors, discoverability, docs, fear of breaking things, etc.)

_(Optional quick poll: “What’s your biggest CLI pain point?”)_

---

## 5. Topic 3 — CLI Inside the Web Portal (15 min)
Goal: Explore expectations for a *Fabric Web CLI*.

Present **two possible directions**:

1. **Inline Interactive Mode**  
   - Lightweight command box  
   - Quick actions / small scripts  
   - “Show me the equivalent CLI command”  
2. **Full Cloud Shell / Terminal**  
   - Persistent environment  
   - Multiple CLIs installed (Fabric CLI, Azure CLI, GitHub CLI, Python, PowerShell…)  
   - Multi‑tenant automation  
   - Import/export files  
   - Script execution at scale  

**Prompts:**
- Which direction would *actually* help you — A, B, or both?  
- What would this shell need preinstalled?  
- Would you expect persistence? Isolation? Tenant scoping?  
- Any security / compliance blockers?

**Mini exercise (chat):**  
*“Write 3 things you would want to do if Fabric gave you a CLI inside the browser.”*

---

## 6. Topic 4 — Copilot + CLI (10 min)
Goal: Identify AI‑assisted CLI value.

**Prompts:**
- How should Copilot behave **inside a terminal**?
- Most valuable Copilot actions:  
  Command generation? Error explanation? Script summarization? Diffing?  
- Would Copilot help you use CLI **more** or **less**?

---

## 7. Wrap-Up & Next Steps (3 min)
- Any scenario we didn’t cover that is important to you?
- Invite them to book **1:1 deep dives** to go technical.  
  (“This roundtable was broad by design — 1:1 sessions will go deep into your workflow.”)
- Thank participants and close.

---

## 8. Follow-Up
- Send booking link for 1:1  
- Option to share early concepts or prototypes later  
- Internal: capture grouped themes & signals
