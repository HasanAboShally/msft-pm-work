# Partner Voice Webcast Poll Questions
## AI-Powered Automation in Fabric with MCP

**Event Date:** December 2025  
**Document Purpose:** Ready-to-use poll questions for Microsoft Forms or Mentimeter

---

## Poll 1: Opening Icebreaker

**Timing:** 0:00 (Start of session)

### Question Text
**"How are you currently automating tasks in Microsoft Fabric?"**

### Answer Options
1. **No automation yet** — We do everything manually in the Fabric portal
2. **Basic scripts** — Simple PowerShell or Python scripts for specific tasks
3. **REST APIs** — Direct API calls for programmatic operations
4. **Power Automate flows** — Using Power Platform for Fabric workflows
5. **CI/CD pipelines** — Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for deployments
6. **Custom tools/frameworks** — We've built internal automation tooling
7. **Exploring options** — Researching but haven't implemented yet

### Suggested Follow-up Discussion Question
> "For those using scripts or APIs—what's the biggest pain point you've encountered? Is it authentication, documentation, or something else?"

### Insights We're Hoping to Gain
- **Baseline understanding** of partner automation maturity levels
- **Identify pain points** with current approaches to address in the session
- **Segment the audience** to tailor content depth (beginners vs. advanced)
- **Validate assumptions** about CLI/MCP demand

## Poll 2: Mid-Session Engagement

**Timing:** 0:18 (After CLI demos)

### Question Text
**"What would you MOST like to automate in Microsoft Fabric?"**

### Answer Options
1. **Workspace management** — Creating, configuring, and organizing workspaces
2. **Data pipeline operations** — Building and scheduling data movement workflows
3. **Lakehouse/warehouse setup** — Provisioning and configuring storage artifacts
4. **Security & permissions** — Managing access, roles, and governance policies
5. **Deployment & promotion** — Moving content across dev/test/prod environments
6. **Monitoring & alerting** — Tracking job health, failures, and performance
7. **Report/semantic model management** — Automating BI artifact lifecycle

### Suggested Follow-up Discussion Question
> "What's driving this priority for you—is it time savings, reducing errors, scaling operations, or something else?"

### Insights We're Hoping to Gain
- **Prioritize roadmap items** based on real partner demand
- **Understand use cases** to improve CLI/MCP command coverage
- **Identify gaps** between current capabilities and partner needs
- **Content for future sessions** based on top-voted scenarios

## Poll 3: Closing Commitment

**Timing:** 0:48 (After MCP demos)

### Question Text
**"How likely are you to use AI agents for Fabric automation in the next 12 months?"**

### Answer Options (5-Point Scale)
1. **Definitely will adopt** — We're ready to implement AI-powered automation now
2. **Very likely** — Strong interest, planning to pilot within 6 months
3. **Somewhat likely** — Interested but need to evaluate further
4. **Unlikely for now** — Current approaches work; may revisit later
5. **Not considering** — AI agents don't fit our automation strategy

### Suggested Follow-up Discussion Question
> "For those who said 'very likely' or 'definitely'—what's the first scenario you'd want to tackle with an AI agent?"

### Insights We're Hoping to Gain
- **Gauge adoption readiness** for MCP-based AI automation
- **Identify early adopters** for preview programs or case studies
- **Understand barriers** from those who are hesitant
- **Measure session effectiveness** in generating interest

## Setup Notes for Microsoft Forms

### Creating the Polls
1. Create a new Form for each poll (or use Sections within one Form)
2. Set each question as **Required**
3. Enable **"Allow multiple responses"** if running live with audience
4. Consider enabling **"Show results after submission"** for live engagement

### Mentimeter Alternative
- Use **"Multiple Choice"** for Polls 1 & 2
- Use **"Scales"** question type for Poll 3
- Enable **"Let audience see results"** for real-time visualization

## Post-Session Analysis

### Key Metrics to Track
- [ ] Distribution across automation maturity levels (Poll 1)
- [ ] Top 3 automation scenarios by vote count (Poll 2)
- [ ] Percentage of "Definitely" + "Very likely" responses (Poll 3)
- [ ] Comparison of interest before/after demos

### Follow-up Actions
- Share anonymized poll results with Product team
- Reach out to "Definitely will adopt" respondents for preview programs
- Address top automation scenarios in future content
