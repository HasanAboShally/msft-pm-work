# Partner Voice Demo Scripts
**Event:** AI-Powered Automation in Fabric with MCP  
**Date:** December 2, 2025

---

## Demo 1: Fabric CLI Basics (8 min)

### Narrative
> "Let me show you how the Fabric CLI lets you treat Fabric like a filesystem. If you've ever used `ls`, `cd`, or `cp` in a terminal, you already know the mental model."

### Commands

```bash
# 1. Check authentication (show you're connected)
fab auth status

# 2. List all workspaces (like 'ls' at root)
fab ls

# 3. List contents of a specific workspace with details
fab ls "Demo-Partner-Voice.Workspace" -l

# 4. Get detailed info about an item
fab get "Demo-Partner-Voice.Workspace/SalesData.Lakehouse"

# 5. Create a new workspace (like mkdir)
fab mkdir "Demo-New-Workspace.Workspace"

# 6. Verify it was created
fab ls "Demo-*.Workspace"

# 7. Copy an item between workspaces (like cp)
fab cp "Demo-Development.Workspace/SampleReport.Report" "Demo-Production.Workspace" -f

# 8. Run a notebook job
fab job run "Demo-Partner-Voice.Workspace/ETL-Process.Notebook"
```

### Talking Points
- ✅ "Notice the familiar filesystem metaphor"
- ✅ "Every command is scriptable - perfect for CI/CD"
- ✅ "The `-l` flag gives you long-form details"
- ✅ "This works in any terminal - Windows, Mac, Linux"

### Fallback
If commands fail, show screenshot and say:
> "Here's what you would see when running this command..."

## Demo 2: Community Innovation - fabric-cli-plugin (7 min)

### Narrative
> "One of our amazing community members, known as 'Data Goblin,' has built an incredible plugin that extends the CLI with AI capabilities. This shows the power of open source + open standards."

### Setup
- Have GitHub page open: `https://github.com/data-goblin/fabric-cli-plugin`
- Have Claude Desktop open (if showing live)

### Demo Flow

**Part A: Show the GitHub Repo (2 min)**
1. Navigate to the repository
2. Highlight key features:
   - 17 MCP tools
   - Claude Code skill
   - Rich documentation

**Part B: Show AI Integration (5 min)**

If using Claude Desktop:
```
User: "List all semantic models in my Sales workspace and check their refresh status"

[Claude uses fabric-cli-plugin to execute commands and return results]
```

### Key Points to Highlight
- ✅ "This is MIT licensed, open source"
- ✅ "Built by a community member, not Microsoft"
- ✅ "Shows the ecosystem potential"
- ✅ "Install with: `/plugin install fabric-cli-plugin@data-goblin`"

### Fallback
Show screenshots of:
1. The GitHub README
2. The tools list
3. Example output

## Demo 3: AI Agent + CLI Integration (10 min)

### Narrative
> "Now let's see the real magic - what happens when we combine Copilot's natural language understanding with CLI's precision. Imagine you need to rename 50 workspaces to match a naming convention. Doing this manually would take hours."

### Scenario Setup
Explain the problem:
> "Our company wants all workspaces to follow the pattern: [Environment]-[Domain]-[Project]. For example: Prod-Sales-Dashboard."

### Demo Script

**Step 1: Natural Language Request**
```
User: "I want all my workspaces to follow this naming pattern: 
       [Environment]-[Domain]-[Project]
       For example: Prod-Sales-Dashboard
       
       Can you analyze my current workspaces and propose new names?"
```

**Step 2: AI Analyzes and Proposes (Show the AI's response)**
```
AI Response:
"I've analyzed your workspaces. Here's my proposal:

| Current Name | Proposed Name |
|--------------|---------------|
| Sales-Prod | Prod-Sales-Main |
| Dev-Analytics | Dev-Analytics-Main |
| Finance_Reports | Prod-Finance-Reports |

I can generate a CLI script to rename these. Would you like me to proceed?"
```

**Step 3: AI Generates CLI Script**
```bash
# Generated by AI Agent
#!/bin/bash
# Workspace Rename Script - Generated 2025-12-02

fab set "Sales-Prod.Workspace" -q displayName -i "Prod-Sales-Main"
fab set "Dev-Analytics.Workspace" -q displayName -i "Dev-Analytics-Main"  
fab set "Finance_Reports.Workspace" -q displayName -i "Prod-Finance-Reports"

echo "Rename complete!"
```

**Step 4: User Reviews and Approves**
> "The user reviews the script - they can see exactly what will happen. They can modify it if needed. Then they execute."

**Step 5: Execute (or show what would happen)**
```bash
# Run the script
./rename-workspaces.sh

# Or run directly:
fab set "Demo-Development.Workspace" -q displayName -i "Dev-Demo-Development"
```

### Key Messages
- ✅ "AI handles the complexity, human retains control"
- ✅ "The script is reusable and auditable"
- ✅ "One script replaces hundreds of AI calls - cost effective"
- ✅ "You can save this script, version it in Git, schedule it"

## Demo 4: Security Officer Web App (8 min)

### Narrative
> "This is a real demo our team built. Imagine you're a security officer who needs to continuously monitor your Fabric environment for vulnerabilities."

### What to Show

**Option A: If you have the app running**
1. Open the Security Officer web app
2. Show it connecting to Fabric via Local MCP
3. Demonstrate a security scan:
   - Workspaces without admins
   - Items with overly permissive access
   - Orphaned connections
4. Show the generated security report

**Option B: If showing architecture only**
Show the architecture diagram and explain:

```
┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│  Web App (React) │ ←→  │ AI Agent    │ ←→  │ Fabric MCP  │
│  Security UI     │     │ (Copilot)   │     │ (Local)     │
└──────────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                                                    ↓
                                             ┌─────────────┐
                                             │ Fabric APIs │
                                             └─────────────┘
```

### Script (Conceptual - what the agent does)
```python
# Pseudocode of what the Security Agent does
1. Connect to Fabric via MCP
2. List all workspaces: fab ls
3. For each workspace:
   - Get role assignments: fab get <workspace> --include-permissions
   - Check for: no admins, external users, stale access
4. List all connections
5. Check for: orphaned, expired credentials
6. Generate report with findings
7. Optionally: auto-remediate (with approval)
```

### Key Messages
- ✅ "This is exactly what YOU can build for your customers"
- ✅ "MCP enables intelligent applications on top of Fabric"
- ✅ "Security + AI + Automation = powerful combination"
- ✅ "Available now in preview"
