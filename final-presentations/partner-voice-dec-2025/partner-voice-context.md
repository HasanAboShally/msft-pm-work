# **Partner Voice Webcast: AI-Powered Automation in Fabric with MCP**

## **Dec 2, 2025, 6:00–7:00 PM IST – Microsoft Teams Meeting**

*This is a confidential Partner Voice session focused on how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI-driven automation in Microsoft Fabric.*

***

**Summary:** *“Partner Voice” webcasts are NDA-protected briefings where Microsoft product teams share upcoming features and roadmaps with select partner leaders and gather their feedback to shape the product. The typical audience is senior technical leads from partner companies, who join to get early insight and influence on Microsoft Fabric’s direction. These 1‑hour sessions are interactive (not marketing pitches) – presenters (usually the PMs owning the feature) demonstrate new capabilities and discuss plans, while partners ask questions and provide input. Tomorrow’s session will be moderated by the Partner Voice program team and led by Fabric product managers working on AI-driven automation via MCP. They will showcase how **Model Context Protocol** connects AI agents to Fabric, including demos of AI agents performing Fabric tasks, an outline of the MCP roadmap, and an invitation to participate in the **Remote MCP** private preview launching January 2026. This “Remote MCP” is a key part of Fabric’s 2026 roadmap – it will enable cloud-hosted AI automation in Fabric, advancing the broader goal of making Fabric an **“AI-native” data platform**. In preparation, it’s useful to know that Microsoft recently open-sourced a **Fabric MCP** server for local development (preview announced Oct 2025), and at Ignite 2025 introduced “**Fabric IQ**” as an initiative to unify AI capabilities across Fabric. The webcast will likely reference these developments to give partners a holistic picture of where Fabric’s AI-powered automation is headed.* [\[Partner Vo...bric's MCP | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr8AAA%3d) [\[blog.fabri...rosoft.com\]](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-fabric-mcp-public-preview/) [\[Fabric MCP...— Nov 2025 | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BAB343BEA-A4A0-4B06-B444-0C4E04EE3C44%7D&file=Fabric%20MCP%20Plans%20%E2%80%94%20Nov%202025.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

### **About the Partner Voice Webcast Series (Purpose, Format, Goals)**

**“Partner Voice”** is an invitation-only advisory program (similar to the Enterprise Voice program) that brings together a community of senior partner experts to improve Microsoft’s data products (primarily Fabric) through their feedback. The **webcast series** is the main engagement mechanism of this program: these are **interactive NDA webinars** where Microsoft’s product team presents upcoming features/changes and **solicits input from partners** in real time. Unlike a marketing webinar, the goal is not promotion but **collaborative feedback** – essentially a two-way dialogue akin to a customer advisory board session. [\[Partner Vo...e Overview | PDF\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/Shared%20Documents/General/Partner%20Voice%20Overview.pdf?web=1), [\[Partner Vo...e Overview | PDF\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/Shared%20Documents/General/Partner%20Voice%20Overview.pdf?web=1) [\[Webcasts | SharePoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EnterpriseVoiceStakeholders/SitePages/Webcasts.aspx?web=1) [\[Enterprise...e Playbook | Word\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EnterpriseVoiceStakeholders/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BC0DA051C-4B41-43C3-83D2-F7883818D6BC%7D&file=Enterprise%20Voice%20Playbook.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

*   **Purpose:** The strategic purpose is to ensure new features align with real-world needs and to give partners an early look at the product roadmap so they can prepare and influence it. By hearing partner perspectives on preview features, Microsoft can refine the product before broad release, and partners feel a sense of co-creation (and gain insight they can use in their business). In short, Partner Voice exists to make Fabric “better for enterprise data & analytics scenarios” by channeling partner expertise into the product planning process. [\[Partner Vo...e Overview | PDF\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/Shared%20Documents/General/Partner%20Voice%20Overview.pdf?web=1), [\[Enterprise...e Playbook | Word\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EnterpriseVoiceStakeholders/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BC0DA051C-4B41-43C3-83D2-F7883818D6BC%7D&file=Enterprise%20Voice%20Playbook.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) [\[Partner Vo...m Overview | SharePoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EnterpriseVoiceStakeholders/SitePages/PV_ProgramOverview.aspx?web=1), [\[Partner Vo...e Overview | PDF\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/Shared%20Documents/General/Partner%20Voice%20Overview.pdf?web=1)

*   **Format:** Each webcast is typically **1 hour via Microsoft Teams**, usually scheduled at 8:00 AM Pacific (which is 6:00 PM in Israel) as part of a regular cadence for the Americas region. All content is under NDA (often explicitly stated at the start) and sessions are recorded only for the private community’s on-demand viewing. The format usually starts with a **brief introduction** by the moderator (covering housekeeping, reminding that the call is confidential and how to use Teams features like live captions). Then the **presenter(s)** – typically Program Managers (PMs) from the product team – take over to present the main content. Presentations generally follow a pattern: [\[Webcasts | SharePoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EnterpriseVoiceStakeholders/SitePages/Webcasts.aspx?web=1) [\[Partner Vo...Recording | Video\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={56ea47be-3270-4d7d-96fb-f5561f044249})

    *   **Context Setting:** A quick recap of customer scenarios or current capabilities to set context for what’s being discussed. [\[Enterprise...e Playbook | Word\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EnterpriseVoiceStakeholders/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BC0DA051C-4B41-43C3-83D2-F7883818D6BC%7D&file=Enterprise%20Voice%20Playbook.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
    *   **What’s New / Coming:** An overview of soon-to-be-released features or improvements, often with **demos or prototypes** to bring them to life. For example, the presenter might show an AI agent performing a Fabric task using MCP in a demo environment. [\[Partner Vo...bric's MCP | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr8AAA%3d)
    *   **Roadmap Outlook:** A preview of longer-term plans or vision in this area, to help attendees understand where the product is headed beyond the immediate updates. (In this case, that likely includes how “Remote MCP” fits into Fabric’s roadmap and future AI integrations.) [\[Enterprise...e Playbook | Word\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EnterpriseVoiceStakeholders/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BC0DA051C-4B41-43C3-83D2-F7883818D6BC%7D&file=Enterprise%20Voice%20Playbook.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
    *   **Call to Action:** Finally, the session concludes with specific next steps or opportunities for partners – e.g. asking for feedback via a survey, inviting them to join a private preview or focus group, or providing links to further resources. In this particular webcast, the call to action is explicitly to consider opting into the **Remote MCP private preview** starting January 2026. [\[Partner Vo...bric's MCP | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr8AAA%3d)

    Throughout the talk, **Q\&A and discussion** are encouraged. The format is “fostering bidirectional discussion with hands-on practitioners”. Partners can typically use the chat or raise hand to ask questions, and the moderator will facilitate. Polls might be used occasionally to gather quick feedback from attendees. The session is meant to be quite interactive; the presenter might pause after demos or key points to solicit reactions. [\[Webcasts | SharePoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EnterpriseVoiceStakeholders/SitePages/Webcasts.aspx?web=1)

*   **Strategic Goals:** The overarching goal of Partner Voice webcasts is to strengthen the feedback loop between Microsoft engineering and implementation experts in the field. For Microsoft, it’s an invaluable chance to **validate planned investments** and identify any fit-and-finish changes needed before features launch broadly. Attendees’ reactions can signal whether a feature is solving the right problems and what blockers or concerns might arise in real customer deployments. For partners, the value is being **better prepared for upcoming capabilities** (so they can plan offerings, skill up, and inform their customers early) and being able to **influence the product direction** based on their on-the-ground experience. In essence, each webcast aims to ensure that by the time a feature like MCP goes public, it has been vetted by expert users and comes with partner buy-in. A successful outcome for these sessions is actionable feedback – e.g. partners might point out a missing capability or ask for a debugging feature in MCP, which the product team can then consider adding before general availability. Another success metric is partner engagement in next steps (such as many partners signing up for the Remote MCP preview, indicating strong interest). [\[Enterprise...e Playbook | Word\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EnterpriseVoiceStakeholders/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BC0DA051C-4B41-43C3-83D2-F7883818D6BC%7D&file=Enterprise%20Voice%20Playbook.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) [\[Partner Vo...e Overview | PDF\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/Shared%20Documents/General/Partner%20Voice%20Overview.pdf?web=1)

Microsoft explicitly differentiates these webcasts from marketing: they are **not about sales or glossy announcements**, but about sharing **NDA information to get candid feedback**. This makes them highly strategic; they build partner trust (partners feel heard and valued) and directly inform product improvements. Over time, this collaboration helps drive adoption – partners who contributed feedback are more likely to champion the product to customers. [\[Enterprise...e Playbook | Word\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EnterpriseVoiceStakeholders/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BC0DA051C-4B41-43C3-83D2-F7883818D6BC%7D&file=Enterprise%20Voice%20Playbook.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

**Bottom line:** The Partner Voice webcast series is a forum for early disclosure and feedback. Its format is a focused one-hour deep dive on a specific topic (like AI automation via MCP), led by the feature’s PMs with demos and roadmap insights, and plenty of Q\&A. The goal is to ensure that by GA, features have been pressure-tested by key partners and that those partners are equipped to leverage (and evangelize) the new capabilities. This aligns everyone’s efforts to ultimately **“make the Microsoft data platform better for enterprise BI & analytics” through partner input**. [\[Partner Vo...m Overview | SharePoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EnterpriseVoiceStakeholders/SitePages/PV_ProgramOverview.aspx?web=1), [\[Partner Vo...e Overview | PDF\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/Shared%20Documents/General/Partner%20Voice%20Overview.pdf?web=1)

### **Typical Audience and Participants**

The **audience** for Partner Voice webcasts is drawn from the **Microsoft partner ecosystem** – specifically, the **Solution Integrator (SI) partners** focused on data analytics and BI. Membership is exclusive and by invitation. Attendees are usually **“data practice leaders”** or senior architects at these partner firms. In practice, this means people like practice directors, lead solution architects, or CTO-level consultants from major Microsoft partner companies (for example, individuals who lead the BI/Fabric practice at a global SI). [\[Partner Vo...e Overview | PDF\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/Shared%20Documents/General/Partner%20Voice%20Overview.pdf?web=1), [\[Partner Vo...e Overview | PDF\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/Shared%20Documents/General/Partner%20Voice%20Overview.pdf?web=1)

*   **Roles and Personas:** Partner Voice members are expected to have **broad knowledge of the BI/data analytics space and hands-on Fabric experience**. They are typically **technical decision-makers** who oversee multiple customer implementations. Many fit the persona of **“practice manager with strong technical expertise”** – e.g. someone who has implemented Fabric or Power BI solutions and can speak to real-world challenges. All members are required to have a solid technical grasp of Fabric’s workloads, since discussions can get fairly deep. These aren’t business or salespeople; they’re the partner’s top technical minds for Fabric. [\[Partner Vo...e Overview | PDF\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/Shared%20Documents/General/Partner%20Voice%20Overview.pdf?web=1), [\[Partner Vo...e Overview | PDF\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/Shared%20Documents/General/Partner%20Voice%20Overview.pdf?web=1) [\[Partner Vo...e Overview | PDF\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/Shared%20Documents/General/Partner%20Voice%20Overview.pdf?web=1)

*   **What they gain / motivation:** These partners join the webcasts to **gain early insight and a voice in the product’s evolution**. Key benefits for Partner Voice members include receiving **“an early look at Microsoft’s data product strategy and roadmap”** and **opportunities to influence product direction**. In other words, they get to see features before public previews and give input that might shape final outcomes. They also gain **direct connections to Microsoft product leaders** (PMs and sometimes engineering or exec sponsors). This access means they can ask tough questions or clarify scenarios, and later they know exactly whom to follow up with for deeper engagements. Essentially, it’s a chance for partners to ensure Microsoft hears the voice of the field – they can raise customer needs or deployment challenges that Microsoft might not be aware of. For example, a partner might say “Feature X looks great, but in highly regulated industries we’d need an audit log – do you support that?” and that feedback could influence the final design. [\[Partner Vo...e Overview | PDF\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/Shared%20Documents/General/Partner%20Voice%20Overview.pdf?web=1)

Additionally, partners benefit by **preparing their own business**: since they learn about upcoming features under NDA, they can ready their consulting offerings, train staff, or inform key clients ahead of time (within the limits of NDA) so they’re ahead of the curve. It’s also a prestige thing — being in Partner Voice signals that a partner is a strategic, trusted advisor to Microsoft and on top of the latest tech. Members are expected to attend regularly and participate actively (those who stay silent or skip out may be removed, per the program guidelines). This ensures the audience is consistently engaged and adding value. [\[Partner Vo...e Overview | PDF\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/Shared%20Documents/General/Partner%20Voice%20Overview.pdf?web=1), [\[Partner Vo...e Overview | PDF\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/Shared%20Documents/General/Partner%20Voice%20Overview.pdf?web=1)

*   **Size of audience:** Attendance can vary by topic, but generally these webcasts draw on the order of **dozens of attendees (often \~40–70)** from partner organizations. It’s mentioned that typical Enterprise Voice sessions get that range of participants, and Partner Voice likely sees similar numbers (sometimes more if the topic is very hot). Because multiple people from the same partner org can join, you might have representation from say 30-40 partner companies on the call. If the topic is of narrower interest, the number might be lower; if it’s broad (like a major Fabric announcement), potentially higher. But it’s not a massive public call – it’s a relatively intimate group of experts. [\[Webcasts | SharePoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EnterpriseVoiceStakeholders/SitePages/Webcasts.aspx?web=1)

*   **What participants are looking for:** In these sessions, partners are **looking to gain actionable information** and **assurances for their plans**. For example, they will be keen to learn *when* a feature might be available to customers, what its limitations are, and how it will help solve known pain points. In tomorrow’s webcast, partners will likely want to understand how MCP could help them automate client deployments or governance, and what “Remote MCP” means for scenarios like controlling multiple customers’ Fabric environments. They will also be listening for any implications on their current projects: e.g., if a partner firm is building custom automation for Fabric today, learning that Microsoft’s own MCP might cover some of that could change their approach (either positively by reducing their workload, or raising concerns if something they rely on might become deprecated in favor of MCP).

Because the audience members often liaise with many customers, they often bring *aggregate feedback* or frequently asked questions from the field. They may ask questions in the webcast like, “We have customers asking if they can integrate their own AI assistants with Fabric – will MCP support connecting third-party AI platforms?” Such questions reflect the voice of multiple clients and help Microsoft gauge demand and requirements beyond what internal teams see.

To summarize, the audience is an elite group of **seasoned partner professionals** who engage in these webcasts to stay ahead and to steer the product. They want early info, influence, and connections. They bring to the table a wealth of **real-world insight** – which is exactly why Microsoft hosts these sessions. The dynamic is mutually beneficial: partners get insider knowledge and the ability to shape features, while Microsoft gets candid feedback from trusted implementers. This dynamic will certainly be in play during the “AI-Powered Automation in Fabric with MCP” session: expect the attendees to probe how MCP will work in practice, and to volunteer use cases or concerns from their implementation experience.

### **Organizers and Speakers (Roles and Relevance to Topic)**

The **organizers** of the Partner Voice webcasts are the Microsoft **Customer Programs team** that runs the “Voice” programs (Enterprise Voice, Partner Voice, ISV Voice). In practice, **Stephanie Chimeziri** (who is listed as an invitee for this meeting) is a key coordinator – she is a Program Manager for Partner Voice, tasked with logistics and community management. Typically an alias like `[Partner Voice](https://www.office.com/search?q=Partner+Voice&EntityRepresentationId=64f2056a-5176-40f3-a17e-0a285987eb41) (<PartnerVoice@service.microsoft.com>)` is the formal “organizer” of the Teams meeting (as seen in the invite), but the session will be facilitated by a **Partner Voice moderator** (often Stephanie or a colleague from the program team). Their role is to handle all the opening/closing logistics and to ensure the meeting runs smoothly (admit attendees from lobby, remind about NDA, moderate the Q\&A, etc.). For example, in a recent Partner Voice call from October, Stephanie began with housekeeping notes and tips on using features like live captions and interpreter in Teams, then introduced the speakers (“today we’ve got *X* and team joining with an update on *Y*...”). We can expect a similar flow tomorrow: the Partner Voice moderator will kick off the call 3 minutes past the hour (8:03 AM Pacific), run through a short welcome deck (covering confidentiality, how to ask questions, upcoming webcast dates, etc.), then hand off to the main presenters. [\[Partner Vo...bric's MCP | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr8AAA%3d) [\[Partner Vo...Recording | Video\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/PartnerVoice/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={56ea47be-3270-4d7d-96fb-f5561f044249}) [\[Webcasts | SharePoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EnterpriseVoiceStakeholders/SitePages/Webcasts.aspx?web=1)

**Speakers:** The main content is delivered by **Microsoft Fabric product team members** – specifically those who own the topic being presented. Partner Voice often recruits the Program Manager(s) responsible for a feature as the presenters, sometimes accompanied by an engineer or a PM from a related area for support. Based on the meeting title *“AI-Powered Automation in Fabric with Fabric’s MCP”*, the likely speakers are the folks driving the MCP initiative in Fabric. One prime candidate is **Hasan Abo Shally** (the user in this case): Hasan is the Senior Product Manager in Fabric leading the MCP and related AI automation efforts (he even authored the public blog introducing Fabric MCP). It’s quite possible Hasan is one of the lead presenters given the subject matter. Alongside, there might be an engineering lead or another PM from the Fabric team – for instance, someone like **Mahir Diab** or **Tal Rostoker** (just to hypothesize based on internal threads, both have been involved in Fabric automation/MCP discussions). The invite also shows **Prashant Gutala** and **Tamer Farag** as invitees; Prashant and Tamer are on the partner ecosystem side (Prashant works on partner programs, Tamer leads Fabric partner strategy). They may not present technical content but could be present to observe or chime in on partner program context. The core technical presentation is likely in the hands of the Fabric PM(s) who built the MCP feature set. [\[blog.fabri...rosoft.com\]](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-fabric-mcp-public-preview/) [\[Partner Vo...bric's MCP | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr8AAA%3d)

**Relevance to topic:** The speakers will have **direct expertise and ownership** of AI-powered automation in Fabric. For example, if Hasan indeed presents, he’s the PM who led the development of Fabric’s MCP (Model Context Protocol implementation) – so he can speak authoritatively about what MCP is, why it was built, and how it will evolve. He also has context on how partners might use it, since he’s been involved in private discussions and specs for Remote MCP and related features. If an engineering lead joins (say, an architect for Fabric’s platform), that person can answer deep technical questions or give a demo of the MCP in action.

In terms of **organizer vs presenter roles** during the session:

*   The **Partner Voice moderator** (organizer) will likely handle introductions and timekeeping. For instance, they’ll make sure the call starts on time and ends on time, manage the recording, and field questions from chat to pass to the presenters. They ensure all attendees are muted when not speaking and unmute presenters at the right times. Essentially, they run the “show” aspect.
*   The **Fabric PM presenter(s)** will handle the content. One of them will share their screen to show slides or demos. They will do the speaking for the bulk of the hour, walking through the agenda points (demos of AI agents doing Fabric tasks, roadmap for MCP, etc.).

It’s common that after the main presentation, the moderator opens up for Q\&A, at which point multiple Microsoft folks on the call might join the discussion. For example, if a partner asks a detailed question about “Remote MCP’s security model,” the PM presenter might answer directly, or they might call on an engineering lead on the call to give a more detailed answer. Sometimes the **Product Lead or Group PM** (if present) might add commentary on strategy or thank partners for feedback at the end.

Given the attendees listed, **Stephanie Chimeziri** (organizer/moderator) and **Hasan Abo Shally** (presenter) likely have coordinated the flow. Stephanie would ensure Hasan has the stage to present, and Hasan (along with any co-presenter) will drive the content. **Prashant Gutala** (who appears invited) is actually a Data & AI program manager who often handles partner advisory programs; Prashant might help moderate or just observe to capture partner feedback. **Tamer Farag** is the Fabric Partner Ecosystem lead – his presence might be to give a brief intro or simply to hear partner reactions, since he’s responsible for partner enablement. It’s possible Tamer could say a few words like “We’re excited to have you all, your feedback is crucial,” but the technical heavy-lifting will be done by the PM who owns MCP.

In summary, the session will be organized by the Partner Voice program management (making sure it runs to plan) and **presented by the Fabric product team experts**. This ensures that partners hear information straight from the source – the people building the feature – and can direct questions to them. It also adds credibility: partners will be hearing from those deeply involved in AI automation for Fabric, not just a facilitator. The speakers’ stake in the topic is high (it’s their feature’s success on the line), which typically leads to an enthusiastic demo and honest discussion. We can anticipate that the **MCP PM (presenter)** will explicitly solicit partner input (“we’re especially interested in your use cases for automation or any concerns you foresee – please let us know during Q\&A”), because the whole point is for them to gather feedback to refine the feature. Meanwhile, the **organizers** ensure that environment of open conversation is maintained and that any follow-up actions (like sharing links to documentation or sign-up forms for the preview) are communicated clearly by the end of the call.

### **Remote MCP Preview (Launching Jan 2026) – Background and Where it Fits in the Roadmap**

One of the key agenda items in this webcast is the **“Remote MCP”** private preview, which is slated to begin in January 2026. To clarify terms: *MCP* stands for **Model Context Protocol**, an open standard (originating from work by Anthropic and adopted by multiple platforms) that enables AI agents to connect to external systems in a structured, secure way. In Fabric’s context, an *MCP server* acts as a middle layer allowing AI copilots or agents to perform actions in Fabric via natural language commands – effectively exposing Fabric’s capabilities (like creating workspaces, modifying items, checking logs) to AI in a controlled manner. [\[Partner Vo...bric's MCP | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr8AAA%3d)

Up until now, Microsoft has introduced a **local MCP** for Fabric (which runs on a developer’s machine and allows AI-assisted development – see the Fabric MCP preview in Oct 2025). The **Remote MCP** is the next evolution: it refers to a **cloud-hosted MCP service for Fabric**. In simpler terms, Remote MCP will let partners and customers use an MCP server that runs in the Fabric cloud (likely managed by Microsoft) to automate Fabric operations without hosting anything locally. [\[blog.fabri...rosoft.com\]](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-fabric-mcp-public-preview/)

**Background and Purpose:** The Remote MCP is being built to overcome certain limitations and to enable broad usage of MCP in production scenarios. The local Fabric MCP (in preview) is great for development and offline code generation, but it doesn’t actually execute changes in the service – it just helps you generate scripts which you then run. Remote MCP, on the other hand, will be able to *directly execute* actions in Fabric on behalf of a user or service, but in a governed way. It’s essentially an **“execution engine”** in the cloud that AI agents (like Fabric’s own Copilot or potentially external AI assistants) can talk to in order to do real work in Fabric. Microsoft’s internal description calls it a “secure, cloud-hosted execution engine that enables AI agents to interact with Microsoft Fabric”. [\[\[SPEC\] Fab...Remote MCP | Word\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9E61D4D9-0722-4781-9002-36A1AFF4A866%7D&file=[SPEC]%20Fabric%20Remote%20MCP.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

By moving MCP to a cloud service, Microsoft aims to **eliminate a lot of integration complexity** for customers/partners. Today, if a partner wanted to let, say, ChatGPT or their own AI bot automate some Fabric tasks, they would have to handle authentication, APIs, and ensure security on their own. Remote MCP will provide a **standardized, pre-authenticated “socket”** into Fabric – meaning it will handle the OAuth2 authentication with Fabric, enforce the user’s permissions (RBAC), and expose a set of “tools” (operations) that an AI agent can call. This significantly lowers the bar for using AI in ops: developers won’t need to build custom wrappers for Fabric’s APIs, they can simply use the MCP endpoint. [\[\[SPEC\] Fab...Remote MCP | Word\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9E61D4D9-0722-4781-9002-36A1AFF4A866%7D&file=[SPEC]%20Fabric%20Remote%20MCP.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

**Launching January 2026 (Private Preview):** The session invites partners to join a **private preview** starting in Jan. This implies that by January, an initial version of Remote MCP will be ready for select customers/partners (“design partners”) to try in a controlled environment. The invite explicitly mentions “opportunity to join the private preview of Remote MCP (launching January 2026)”. In the roadmap, this corresponds to what internal documents call **M0 or Milestone 0** of Remote MCP – essentially the first preview release. The goals for that milestone are to have **core platform capabilities** in place and tested with a small group of users, and to **gather feedback** to iterate further. [\[Partner Vo...bric's MCP | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr8AAA%3d) [\[\[SPEC\] Fab...Remote MCP | Word\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9E61D4D9-0722-4781-9002-36A1AFF4A866%7D&file=[SPEC]%20Fabric%20Remote%20MCP.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

From an internal spec snippet for Remote MCP: *“M0 – Private Preview (January 2026): Core platform capabilities with existing tools. Validate with design partners and gather feedback.”*. This matches exactly what’s being offered to Partner Voice members: they can become those design partners who will validate the feature. In practical terms, the initial preview will likely allow a set of basic operations via MCP – such as: [\[\[SPEC\] Fab...Remote MCP | Word\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9E61D4D9-0722-4781-9002-36A1AFF4A866%7D&file=[SPEC]%20Fabric%20Remote%20MCP.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

*   **Authentication flows:** e.g. connecting an AI agent using a user’s identity and via service principal (so both interactive and headless auth). Making sure that the agent only can do what that identity is allowed to do.

*   **Workspace and Item CRUD:** creating, listing, updating, deleting Fabric workspaces and items (like Lakehouses, Pipelines, etc.) programmatically.

*   **Audit and Governance hooks:** ensuring actions done through the MCP appear in Fabric’s audit logs for traceability.

*   **Scheduled enforcement:** possibly the ability to run governance tasks (like checking compliance) via an agent continuously using service principal auth.

These are examples derived from the requirements list. Essentially, the preview will confirm that an AI agent can do the fundamental admin tasks in Fabric through this protocol and nothing more – advanced or nice-to-have features will come later. “Remote MCP” here likely is Fabric’s **Hosted MCP** service. In fact, another internal reference calls it **Fabric Platform MCP (hosted)**, which is slated to reach public preview a bit later. [\[\[SPEC\] Fab...Remote MCP | Word\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9E61D4D9-0722-4781-9002-36A1AFF4A866%7D&file=[SPEC]%20Fabric%20Remote%20MCP.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

**Broader Roadmap Fit:** The introduction of Remote MCP is a cornerstone in Fabric’s **AI-driven roadmap**. Microsoft has communicated a vision of Fabric as not just a data platform, but an “**Intelligent Data Platform**” – often using the term **Fabric IQ** for this initiative. At Ignite 2025 (last month), they announced *Fabric IQ* with the tagline “From Data Platform to Intelligence Platform”, emphasizing integrating AI deeply. The idea is that by 2026, Fabric will have AI assistance woven throughout: not only in user-facing features (Copilot that writes queries or creates visuals) but also in administrative and operational aspects (AI agents that help manage and optimize the system). The **Unified Fabric Copilot** is one such concept – a single conversational AI that can handle tasks across all of Fabric’s workloads. [\[Fabric MCP...— Nov 2025 | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BAB343BEA-A4A0-4B06-B444-0C4E04EE3C44%7D&file=Fabric%20MCP%20Plans%20%E2%80%94%20Nov%202025.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

**Remote MCP is the execution backbone for this Unified Copilot vision.** In an internal spec, it’s noted that *“Remote MCP is the execution backbone for the Unified Copilot initiative... delivering a consistent, persistent intelligent interface across all Fabric workloads”*. Essentially, to have a truly unified Copilot that can not only chat but also take actions (like provision a dataset, adjust a setting, or launch a pipeline), Fabric needs a back-end service that the Copilot can call to perform those actions. Remote MCP provides that standardized back-end. It orchestrates multiple specialized “agents” or tools behind the scenes in response to Copilot’s requests. So, launching the preview in Jan 2026 is one stepping stone – Microsoft intends to gather feedback and then likely move to a **public preview by around March 2026** (the Partner Voice invite hints at timeline: Jan preview, and an internal planning note says Public Preview announcement at “FabCon Atlanta (March 2026)”). If all goes well, a **GA (General Availability)** could happen by mid-2026 (one target mentioned is GA by Microsoft Build 2026 in May). [\[\[SPEC\] Fab...Remote MCP | Word\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9E61D4D9-0722-4781-9002-36A1AFF4A866%7D&file=[SPEC]%20Fabric%20Remote%20MCP.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) [\[Fabric Hosted MCP | ADO Work Item (PowerBI)\]](https://dev.azure.com/powerbi/3a3467dc-0814-4e9d-8eec-555851655f69/_workitems/edit/1893508)

To put it simply for a partner audience:

*   **Remote MCP = Fabric’s built-in means for AI to do real work in the service.**
*   In the immediate term (H1 2026), it will roll out as a preview that partners can test, focusing on admin and DevOps scenarios (things like automated workspace management, bulk operations, etc.).
*   This feature sits at the intersection of **platform and AI** – it’s clearly part of the “Platform” pillar of Fabric (the underlying infrastructure enabling new experiences). Microsoft sees it as crucial to **position Fabric as “the industry leader in AI-native data platform automation.”** In fact, an internal epic description states that goal explicitly: *Hosted MCP’s strategic value is that AI agents can securely automate Fabric operations, reducing integration complexity, with enterprise-grade governance – “positioning Fabric as the industry leader in AI-native data platform automation.”*. [\[Fabric Hosted MCP | ADO Work Item (PowerBI)\]](https://dev.azure.com/powerbi/3a3467dc-0814-4e9d-8eec-555851655f69/_workitems/edit/1893508)

For the roadmap: after the private preview (M0), feedback will likely lead to improvements and more features (M1, M2... e.g. adding nicer-to-have capabilities like selective tool enablement, cross-agent coordination, etc.). By public preview, it may support more scenarios (maybe tie-ins with VS Code, or supporting more Fabric workloads like Real-Time Analytics, etc.). By GA, the plan is to have a robust service with full region support, production SLAs, and integration into the Fabric portal (perhaps as a setting where an admin can enable their “Fabric Copilot backend”). [\[\[SPEC\] Fab...Remote MCP | Word\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9E61D4D9-0722-4781-9002-36A1AFF4A866%7D&file=[SPEC]%20Fabric%20Remote%20MCP.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1), [\[\[SPEC\] Fab...Remote MCP | Word\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9E61D4D9-0722-4781-9002-36A1AFF4A866%7D&file=[SPEC]%20Fabric%20Remote%20MCP.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) [\[\[SPEC\] Fab...Remote MCP | Word\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9E61D4D9-0722-4781-9002-36A1AFF4A866%7D&file=[SPEC]%20Fabric%20Remote%20MCP.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

**How it fits with partners and customers:** Remote MCP will likely be offered initially to a small set of customers/partners in Jan – perhaps those present on this call could volunteer. Microsoft will want design partners who can give frequent feedback. Partners who try Remote MCP could, for example, attempt to automate a common deployment task for one of their customer projects using the MCP and then report back any issues or gaps. This is precisely the kind of validation needed before broad rollout.

Additionally, this feature underscores to partners that **Microsoft is serious about automation and AI in Fabric**. For a partner, the remote MCP means down the line they might not need to write as much custom code to integrate Fabric into AI-driven workflows – Microsoft will provide a supported way. It also hints at new services or consulting opportunities: helping clients use Fabric’s AI automation, or building custom “agents” that leverage MCP for specific governance tasks.

So, in tomorrow’s webcast, expect the presenters to explain *what Remote MCP is, why it’s important,* and *how it works at a high level*, then crucially, *how partners can get involved (the preview)*. They will likely position it in the context of the Fabric roadmap: e.g., “We introduced a local MCP in October – now Remote MCP is coming in Jan as private preview – later in 2026 we’ll integrate this into the Fabric product for everyone, enabling a unified Copilot experience and more.” They might show a conceptual demo: e.g., typing a natural language command and having Fabric create a workspace live, illustrating remote MCP in action.

To summarize the **broader context**: The Remote MCP preview is a major milestone in making Fabric an AI-powered platform. It builds on the initial MCP work (local dev preview) and heads toward the ultimate vision of Fabric with deeply embedded AI agents. It addresses a known challenge (“integration complexity” is cited by 62% of enterprises as a top barrier for AI adoption) by providing a straightforward, secure integration point. In Microsoft’s internal strategy, Remote MCP is not an isolated feature – it’s part of a cohesive push including: [\[Fabric-MCP-Plans | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B8D924459-A2C2-4DF0-9246-39C234EFB803%7D&file=Fabric-MCP-Plans.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

*   A unified Copilot for Fabric’s end-users,
*   Pro developer tools like the local MCP and CLI for automation,
*   and a **Platform MCP (Remote)** for operational automation.

All of which converge to make fabric a more **intelligent, autonomous platform** that partners and customers can harness. Therefore, this preview is basically the first time partners get to touch the “brains” that will drive Fabric’s AI operations in the future.

### **Recent Developments & Announcements Relevant to AI-Powered Automation in Fabric**

In the lead-up to this session, there have been several notable developments in Microsoft Fabric’s AI and automation story that provide useful context:

*   **Introduction of Fabric MCP (Preview) – October 2025:** Microsoft publicly announced the Model Context Protocol for Fabric in early October via a Microsoft Fabric blog post. This was essentially the rollout of the **Fabric Local MCP** server for developers. The blog (authored by Hasan Abo Shally) describes Fabric MCP as *“a developer-focused framework that brings together Fabric’s public APIs, item definitions, and best-practice guidance into a unified context layer designed for AI-assisted development”*. Key to note: this MCP server runs locally and provides all the context (OpenAPI specs, JSON schemas for Fabric objects, etc.) that an AI coding assistant (like GitHub Copilot in VS Code) would need to generate Fabric code. It does **not** directly modify cloud resources, but it helps developers write correct code or deployment scripts for Fabric. This preview is open-source and invites contributions, aligning Fabric with the broader open MCP ecosystem and signaling that Microsoft wants community involvement in expanding templates and use cases. [\[blog.fabri...rosoft.com\]](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-fabric-mcp-public-preview/) [\[blog.fabri...rosoft.com\]](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-fabric-mcp-public-preview/), [\[blog.fabri...rosoft.com\]](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-fabric-mcp-public-preview/)

    *Why this matters:* It was the first concrete step in Fabric’s AI automation journey — giving partners and developers a tool to experiment with AI-driven automation safely. Partners in the program likely took note or even started playing with it. For instance, some partners may have tried having GitHub Copilot (with the MCP plugin) generate pipelines or dataset definitions. The learnings from the local MCP set the stage for the *remote MCP.* One huge takeaway is that the concept works: partners saw that AI can understand Fabric schemas and APIs when given the MCP context (reducing hallucinations and errors). The local MCP preview also flushed out initial feedback on what tasks people want to automate. For example, perhaps partners said “This is great for writing code, but we wish the AI could just execute changes directly in Fabric” – which is exactly what Remote MCP aims to fulfill. So the October release is directly related; tomorrow’s session likely will recap it briefly to differentiate local vs. remote MCP and explain how one leads to the other.

*   **Microsoft Ignite 2025 (November 2025) – “Fabric IQ” and AI Integration Push:** At Ignite (mid-November), Microsoft made several announcements reinforcing that **AI is central to Fabric’s roadmap.** The term *“Fabric IQ”* was introduced as an umbrella for turning Fabric into an “Intelligence Platform”. While details are light in public materials, internally this encompassed unifying the various Copilots and AI features in Fabric and adding new ones. One sound bite: *“Just announced: Fabric IQ (Nov 18, 2025) – ‘From Data Platform to Intelligence Platform’”*, emphasizing that Fabric will increasingly deliver AI-driven experiences out of the box. [\[Fabric-MCP-Plans | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B8D924459-A2C2-4DF0-9246-39C234EFB803%7D&file=Fabric-MCP-Plans.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

    Some concrete things around Ignite:

    *   **Unified Copilot vision:** Currently, Fabric had multiple Copilots (Power BI Copilot, Data Factory Copilot, etc.). Ignite sessions hinted at moving toward a one Copilot that can handle queries across all parts of Fabric. Achieving this requires something like MCP to orchestrate across services.
    *   **Industry momentum for AI Agents:** Microsoft shared industry stats in presentations – e.g., “68% of orgs expect integrated AI agents by 2026” and “15,000+ MCP servers deployed globally”. This shows that the idea of using AI agents in enterprise applications is taking off quickly, and Microsoft is aligning Fabric to that trend. The mention of thousands of MCP servers globally is likely referencing the uptake of MCP in open-source and other platforms (like GitHub’s MCP, Azure’s MCP, etc.), indicating a growing ecosystem. [\[Fabric-MCP-Plans | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B8D924459-A2C2-4DF0-9246-39C234EFB803%7D&file=Fabric-MCP-Plans.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
    *   **Fabric Copilot updates:** There were likely Ignite updates to the user-facing Copilots (like new capabilities for the BI Copilot). While not directly about automation, it creates a backdrop that Fabric is becoming more AI-powered for end users, not just admins.

    For partners, the Ignite messaging reinforced that **Microsoft is investing heavily in AI for Fabric**, which includes automation of operations (the very topic at hand). It’s very possible some Ignite breakout sessions touched on MCP or related tech — for instance, the Azure Data team announced an *Azure MCP Server (Preview)* around the same time (allowing AI to perform Azure resource tasks). Knowing that Azure has an MCP and Fabric has one suggests a future where multiple MCP servers interconnect (the open standard nature means an AI agent could coordinate between Azure and Fabric, etc.). [\[What is th...soft Learn | Learn.Microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/overview), [\[What is th...soft Learn | Learn.Microsoft.com\]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/overview)

*   **Private Preview of Hosting MCP servers on Azure (Nov 2025):** In a related technical development, Azure’s Functions team announced the ability to host custom MCP servers on Azure Functions (public preview). This is a bit tangential but shows the broader context: Microsoft is enabling MCP everywhere. If a partner builds their own MCP server (say, to expose a third-party system to AI), they can now host it on Azure easily. The reason this might come up is if partners ask, “Will Fabric’s MCP be open for extension or self-hosting?” Microsoft might say, “our approach is a hosted service in Fabric for now, but note that MCP servers in general can be self-hosted too (for other systems).” It underscores that MCP is becoming a standard approach in the Microsoft ecosystem for AI integration.

*   **Enterprise Voice & Developer Voice sessions on MCP (late 2025):** In addition to Partner Voice, there were *Developer Voice* webcasts in Nov 2025 focusing on MCP (for example, a Developer Voice session on Nov 12, 2025 about “Building and Scaling MCP Servers and Agents” where internal teams and perhaps some partners discussed technical aspects). If any Partner Voice members also attend Developer Voice, they might have seen that. It indicates a lot of cross-community interest in MCP. Also, Enterprise Voice (customer advisory) likely had or will have sessions on aspects of Fabric automation as well. So MCP isn’t only being discussed with partners – customers are hearing about it too under NDA. This means by the time it goes public, a number of early adopters (both partners and customers) will already be somewhat familiar.

*   **Fabric CLI and Automation Tools:** Another relevant development is the ongoing enhancement of the **Fabric CLI** (command-line interface) and related automation features. Earlier in 2025, Partner Voice webcasts covered the introduction of Fabric CLI (e.g., a Partner Voice session in Feb 2025 was about Fabric CLI, presented by Hasan Abo-Shally, showing Microsoft’s emphasis on programmatic control of Fabric). The reason this matters: It’s all part of the theme of making Fabric more approachable for DevOps and automation. The CLI provides a scripting interface, and now MCP provides an AI-driven interface – both ultimately serve to automate Fabric tasks. Partners who have been following those updates will see Remote MCP as a complementary tool: CLI for direct scripting, MCP for AI agent-driven automation. They might ask how the two interplay (perhaps the MCP can even call CLI commands behind the scenes, though likely it uses the same API layer). [\[Fabric CLI...— 20250220 | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BCB8BBF6C-0E61-4359-A719-D9E8956CC98C%7D&file=Fabric%20CLI%20@%20Partners%20Voice%20%E2%80%94%2020250220.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

*   **Emerging Feedback & Use Cases from Preview Programs:** Although not an “announcement,” by now (Dec 2025) Microsoft has gathered a lot of feedback from initial MCP experiments. Internal notes from customer design partners (in Fabric Private Preview) highlight use cases:

    *   Partners/customers want to use MCP to **enforce governance rules** or encapsulate best practices (so that AI doesn’t do something out of policy). [\[Fabric aut...w - Nov 25 | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/tarostok_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B34E16F12-FF64-47AE-99EA-73988068E6E3%7D&file=Fabric%20automation%20and%20embedded%20execution%20review%20-%20Nov%2025.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1), [\[Fabric aut...w - Nov 25 | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/tarostok_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B34E16F12-FF64-47AE-99EA-73988068E6E3%7D&file=Fabric%20automation%20and%20embedded%20execution%20review%20-%20Nov%2025.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
    *   Some see MCP as a way to implement “guardrails” – e.g., one quote: *“Customers see MCPs as delegated control points that must be auditable, scoped, and compliant”* – which drives how Remote MCP is designed (with audit logs, RBAC enforcement). [\[Kr Q1 cut lines | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/teams/FY20Planning56/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE66BDB20-C470-4C35-B644-7EC8D8C15D86%7D&file=Kr%20Q1%20cut%20lines.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
    *   Others voiced that MCP’s real value is in **abstracting complexity** (“encapsulating best practices and metadata – not just executing tasks”) – meaning partners want higher-level toolkits from MCP, not just raw APIs. This kind of insight might be shared to say “we heard this in earlier feedback and we’re working on it.” [\[Kr Q1 cut lines | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/teams/FY20Planning56/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE66BDB20-C470-4C35-B644-7EC8D8C15D86%7D&file=Kr%20Q1%20cut%20lines.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
    *   There’s caution about **“consumption anxiety”** – customers worry about cost/unintended consequences of letting AI loose on their infrastructure. So Microsoft likely will reassure how MCP has guardrails (like requiring explicit user action for certain tasks, etc.). [\[Kr Q1 cut lines | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/teams/FY20Planning56/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE66BDB20-C470-4C35-B644-7EC8D8C15D86%7D&file=Kr%20Q1%20cut%20lines.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

    These points come from internal feedback slides and likely will be discussed or have been discussed in other forums. Bringing it up in tomorrow’s session would show partners that Microsoft is aware of the concerns (e.g., ensuring using an AI agent won’t rack up unexpected costs or do something dangerous without approval). It sets the stage that Remote MCP will include features like approval workflows or dry-run modes in future iterations.

*   **AI enhancements in Fabric’s core services:** Microsoft Fabric’s various workloads (Warehouse, Data Factory, Power BI) are individually getting AI enhancements (like intelligent suggestions, automation of tasks). For example, Data Factory has an AI-powered mapping suggestion, Power BI is getting AI-generated measures, etc. While these are not directly about MCP, they contribute to the overall context that “Fabric is embedding AI everywhere.” The specific focus here is on the **automation of platform operations**, which historically is less glamorous but critically important. This Partner Voice session is essentially addressing that slice: “how do we make the *management* of Fabric AI-driven,” whereas many Ignite announcements were about using AI *within* Fabric for analytics. Partners likely care about both, but this session fills in the operational piece.

To **prioritize what’s most relevant** for tomorrow’s discussion:

1.  **Fabric MCP (local)** – already in preview, demonstrates Microsoft’s commitment to AI tooling and gave partners a testbed. It’s directly relevant because Remote MCP builds on the same concept. Partners should recall what Fabric MCP is (the presenters will likely recap it briefly) to appreciate what Remote MCP adds. **** [\[blog.fabri...rosoft.com\]](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-fabric-mcp-public-preview/)
2.  **Remote MCP (hosted)** – the star of the show, now being unveiled for preview. It’s a fresh development (the invite itself might be the first formal invitation many partners see for it). We have internal context that it’s part of the Unified Copilot plan and that it’s due for public preview by spring and GA later – the presenters will probably share a trimmed version of that roadmap (e.g., “private preview Jan, broader availability aiming mid-2026”). **** [\[Partner Vo...bric's MCP | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr8AAA%3d), [\[Fabric Hosted MCP | ADO Work Item (PowerBI)\]](https://dev.azure.com/powerbi/3a3467dc-0814-4e9d-8eec-555851655f69/_workitems/edit/1893508)
3.  **Ignite 2025 – AI vision (Fabric IQ)** – relevant strategic framing. It tells partners that the highest levels of Microsoft are pushing for AI-driven capabilities in Fabric. Therefore, features like MCP have strong executive support and are likely to evolve quickly. Also, if any announcements from Ignite (like fabric’s AI enhancements or Azure MCP) flew under a partner’s radar, this is a chance to connect the dots. **** [\[Fabric MCP...— Nov 2025 | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BAB343BEA-A4A0-4B06-B444-0C4E04EE3C44%7D&file=Fabric%20MCP%20Plans%20%E2%80%94%20Nov%202025.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
4.  **Cross-product MCP adoption** – Azure’s preview, GitHub’s MCP (which went GA earlier in 2025), etc., show MCP is not experimental but becoming mainstream. This bolsters confidence that investing time in MCP (learning it, trying it out) is worthwhile for partners as it’s not going away. It’s an open standard backed by multiple vendors.
5.  **Upcoming initiatives** – possibly mention that an *Agentic Automation* approach is being taken across services. There’s a note that by H2 2025, Fabric planned a “Platform Gateway MCP” to unify multiple MCP servers under one umbrella in Fabric. If the presenters are very open, they might hint at future plans like a “Gateway MCP” which would allow multiple domains (BI, Data Science, etc.) to plug into one interface – but that might be too forward-looking for this audience right now. Still, it shows longer-term direction: after Remote MCP for core Fabric, the next steps could integrate specialized MCPs across all Fabric workloads.

In essence, the key recent development is **the shift from concept to reality for AI ops in Fabric**:

*   Concept phase was earlier 2025 (exploring MCP, talking about it, blog posts).
*   Reality phase started with the local MCP preview in Oct.
*   And now accelerating with remote MCP preview in Jan.

The webcast itself is a form of announcement: it’s sharing with partners that “Remote MCP is here (in preview form) and here’s how you can use it and help us refine it.”

One can say Microsoft is hitting an **inflection point** where Fabric’s AI automation is moving from prototype to product. This Partner Voice meeting is timed perfectly to get partners on board at that inflection.

**Recap of these developments for a quick view:**

*   *Oct 2025:* Fabric MCP (local) released for preview, enabling AI-assisted coding for Fabric – first step in AI ops. [\[blog.fabri...rosoft.com\]](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-fabric-mcp-public-preview/)
*   *Nov 2025:* Ignite highlights “Fabric as an AI-driven platform” (Fabric IQ), indicating features like MCP are strategically important. [\[Fabric-MCP-Plans | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B8D924459-A2C2-4DF0-9246-39C234EFB803%7D&file=Fabric-MCP-Plans.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
*   *Nov 2025:* Many AI integration previews across MS (Azure MCP, Functions hosting for MCP, etc.) – showing ecosystem momentum.
*   *Dec 2025:* Internal progress – Remote MCP spec ready, preview about to launch. Feedback from early trials emphasizes security, governance, multi-agent orchestration (which likely influenced Remote MCP’s design we’ll see).

*   *Jan 2026 (near future):* Remote MCP private preview begins – partners will have a chance to play with it in real Fabric environments, marking the beginning of real AI-driven Fabric operations.
*   *Beyond:* Public previews and GA mid-year, leading to fully integrated Copilot experiences.

All of this context will help you ask informed questions during the webcast (for example, inquiring how the Remote MCP will handle certain governance scenarios that were identified, or how it might integrate with existing tools like Fabric CLI or pipeline APIs) and understand the answers in light of where things are headed.

The presenters will likely focus on explaining things clearly for those who haven’t followed every development, but since you have this holistic view, you’ll be able to connect the dots. For instance, if they mention “Fabric IQ” or “Unified Copilot,” you know that’s part of the bigger picture from Ignite. If they mention “private preview M0 scope,” you know roughly which features are included from the spec. And importantly, you’ll recognize that **this Partner Voice session is not an isolated event but part of a continuum of Fabric’s transformation with AI – with key milestones that have just happened and more to come in the next 1–2 quarters.**
