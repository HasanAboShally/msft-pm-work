Now, I need your help working on workstreams C+E... as I think they are connected. I might need to do something like: Vision --> hypothesis --> collect feedback +  research + bring evidince. Because in the vision, I can't stay on the vision and convince others by it alone.. I need to bring evidence...
but first, I want to align myself on the vision and make sure it makes sense.. and then break it down to components and show how the user-research effort relates to it and help us validate it..

Also, this goes beyond just integrating the CLI in the web.. it also touches upon other components such as for exmaple the ability to have our remote MCP execute CLI scripts, instead of building direct api-wrapper tools (i also need supportive evidince for that.. here are two links that might provide some initial direction: https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/ and https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/code-execution-with-mcp).

So I feel this will help us organize the different efforts together and tell a much larger story that people would connect to. So I need to make that vision clear and then derive from that the efforts of the research and keep it focused, derive the impact on the specs, et cetera. So that's why I need to break to break this down into different layers and see how they've affect the different efforts that we're currently having. So to get us started, I let me try to illustrate the vision I am having. So I think with the unified copilot coming to the fabric portal, I doubt there will be any usage of the sea line because I'm asking myself, like, why would people? Use a CLI and try to remember the commands or um, work with the CLI commands while they can just write in plain English for the copilot and the copilot does the magic behind the scenes and, you know, it's much more tolerant to mistakes and they can write things there and Taco Bell just execute them. So that's that's one thing. The only maybe use cases I could see to that is that the copilot costs money and the CI could run, for example, for free. Because, you know, the, and the co-parity would still need tokens and UI credit, AI, sorry, AI, credits, et cetera. while the CII, it just used the APIs, so as a user, you don't pay for that. So maybe that's one use case. The other use case is the use case of bulk actions, which I assume the kinified copirate will have harder time doing, like if I have 100s of workspaces and I want to rename them or make sure they follow an end conviction. It will be easier to do that via script, than to do it via copilot. Like, like, it's more programmatic than agentic. both in terms of cost and also in terms of determinism. So I want to illustrate those advantages maybe for still for programmatic approach on the over the agentic approach. I would like you also to do some research on the internet around how this, you know, what the industry is saying around this issues, about, you know, using scripting versus using agents, et cetera. And when to use which. And what I personally think could benefit here is having the agents write scripts, and I think that aligns with some of the articles I shared above. Were you right? An agent that executes code, and I think, If we do that, then if that code is a CLI code, then it's much simpler for the users to understand that code, because for example, instead of, you know, reading 20 lines that talks about authentication, or, you know, do the authentication and and retries for the API or whatever, you just try it like a single line in the in the sea line, it just works and it's much more human readable and More friendly for users to read, especially for the citizen developers. The thing that way we can also help them like learn the CI bit by bit. So the way I envision this is that you go into the portala as a user, you have the right side. For example, you have the fabrico pilot, and then you have the bottom drawer of the, or put on panel, bottom panel of the fabric CI. And you can write CI commands directly, if that's, you know, the way you want to work, if you're like a pro developer and you just now see fabric portal becoming more similar to V. Scott, for example, where you have your agent on the right side and then you have your terminals on the bottom side, like it will make you make fabric portal feel more familiar to pro developers, and then, you know, if they would like, they could just jump into their portal or jump into the sea light, kind of the terminal, and start to write sea light code. So that's one use uses. Use it. The other one is also similar to how terminal and copilot, for example, and this code GitHub copilot, this code work together, is that when you write something to the agent, it can execute, um, common line commands in your terminal, and that there's some scenology between the two. So, The CLI in our case, for example, becomes another tool that, uh, Fabric copalute can use to execute stuff. And I think this brings a lot of value because in the CNI, we're already, we're already doing the hard work of wrapping the APIs and working around APIs and making the entire surface available and working with, for example, one lake APIs and part VI APIs and arm, other arm APIs for the fabric capacities, for example. So we're already doing that work and we don't need to duplicate that work in the remote MCP. So if the remote MCV just provides a tool to run, to generate and execute, see, like, code, that will make life much more easier and help us reuse the code that we're investing in in the CI. And the other thing is that the salon had much more stretcher and stronger capabilities than the guy surface. Because, uh, salon has runtime and works like kind of kind of a sandbox, uh, which is, again, relates to the cloud flare blog above. So the CI become kind of a sandbox that the agent could use to execute additional stuff. For example, if the agent want to modify the finishing files or want to do additional stuff, they could use, utilize the CI to do, to do this instead of, you know, saving that in the context of the agent and trying to do it, um, like live patching or life changing of the, of the files. So I think that's another point why it makes sense to run the CLI code. And we can think of additional ones. For example, we, the sea lies open, open sourced and the community is providing and writing additional commands and additional capabilities and expanding the capabilities of the CI. So, the fabric agent will build those capabilities for free. So that's not a thing where it becomes to kind of work together. And I think that Um... I think one additional point that we can think about is that if, for example, let's take the workspace renaming, um, example that we talked about earlier, about making sure we follow the contention, like the workspaces in my tenant or follows the naming convention. If I want to do that, so maybe I could use Copal to just read the script and have the CLI run it, but it probably, I want, I would want to run the script multiple times or not just a single time. So the question becomes okay, how where could I save this project and schedule it runs, for example? And that's where I think we can think about the, the part where we need a way to run CLI scripts from the service. So we're currently exploring exploring how to do that from a notebook from fabric notebooks from like CLI code, and I think we can maybe think about UDFs, like user data functions, although it's a bit different. Or we can also think about having a CI script item. Like imagine that you have a CI script item where you can configure the version of the CI you want, you can configure, for example, additional parameters or configurations for the CI. And then you can write a script, let's say in partial or in bash, that um, gets executed when you run this item. So this item will work with the scheduler, will work with the jobs API, so you can, you know, run it, et cetera. And that way, you can, you know, build your internal as a company or as a tenant build your internal, um, see nice scripts, or, you know, we can even stretch this further and say, okay, we can have a community like in the open source project, we have a community of example, uh, code, or example, scripts, and people could start to share those, and we maybe add in the, in the portal at the future, where you can, when you open a sealized script, you can start it from a boiler blade of community code, like you can take something that people publish on the, and examples, ripo, or useful, seni script, ripo, and just inject that into the CI script item you just opened, and that's totally opens a total different, an entire surface of value that we can bring to our customers from the innovation that the community is doing and sharing with each other to the, to the service itself. It's kind of a marketplace for the CI scripts, useful CI scripts, so then the service. I think that's, that could be or become super valuable. I'm relating to this or talking about it as something that is, you know, kind of community and open, maybe we can think about some monetization that people could, you know, be writing scripts and selling them within the platform, but I think that's a stretch for the current thinking. So that's why I think that all of those efforts tie together and I want to make sure that the research that we're going to do, we're about to do. kind of help us things think more holistically. We were saying, okay, what does it look like to have a sea lion in the service? So what I think we should do now, I hope I didn't like miss any note here. Let me just check one for 12nd. Yeah, another thing this could relate to is the blueprint. So the blueprint item, I think you can find reference about it in the different files we have in this project. The blue brand item kind of have a speck of an environment that you can, you would need then to execute this blue brand item, to create the environment, or to create a change within it. I think having the seal on the surface could also serve this item. I can say, okay, the item of the blueprint. When it's executed, it's actually converts the spec to a CI script and just runs that. And I think this makes the CI more integrated into the system and brings much more value, not just as an end user tool, but also as an integrative component within fabric that, you know, serves a lot of things and simplifies, simplifies a lot of things. Because again, the CI encapsulates, stronger abilities that are magnified and um, enriched by the community and also just more, like less code, more value, et cetera. So I think it could serve multiple, um, fronts within fabric. And that's, I think, it's, that's why I think it's key to figure out what's the best way to run the CI remote CI code remotely. Like in the service, because the CI needs a local machine to run, so maybe we can run it in sparkling fabric, maybe like we'd need to think about where does that gets us? For example, if we get the CLA installed and all the spark image, like in the default spark image, within fabric, if we get the CLA package there, then, you know, everything in fabric and ram CLA, like notebooks will be able to run CLA, etc. because it's an underlying infrastructure within fabric. And I think that's my vision for the sea lion in general to become an enabling component of fabric and not just like a mere developer tool. So, that's how I see kind of say holistically, and I think, Amir, the CEO of Fabric, I think, he could be sharing a similar vision. So what I want to do is I want to illustrate this vision, put it together in very like concise and nice way. and very well organized and very well articulated. And then from there start to kind of map the different efforts around it because I think it touches almost all different efforts I'm involved in, like including the MCPs and those things. And I want to be able to present this vision. So what I need you to do now, I'm giving you here a lot of context, so I need you to Take it, break it down, organize it in a file. Let's say let's like call it the CI vision or something like that. And then from there, like make sure to include all the details and the micro stuff that I also mentioned here. Make sure everything is captured from it. I just said. And then let's dive into work. And, and, you know, continue that from there to the, see how does this affect the custom research research we're doing and other stuff to build up towards this vision or to validate it.
