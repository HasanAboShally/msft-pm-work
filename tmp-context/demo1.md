### **Demo 1 \- Setting up the Project**

Persona: Platform Engineer  
Core message: "set up everything you need with IaC \- once, consistently, and repeatably"

| Area | Script | What to explain | Open issues/ AIs |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  | Start state \- Platform engineer runs an ADO pipeline. | Explain that the pipeline contains Terraform code and CLI run Terraform for Fabric Environment provisioning CLI for Copy Data and Data Transformation. Start with diagram \- laying out the whole project, and the flow of work we will go through across the session While approving the plan \- explain the project content that will be created in Fabric by Terraform. |  |
| Setting up the Project \- Alon Baram and Evelina Alroy-Brin Hasan Abo Shally Yaron Pri Gal | Using TF to deploy: multi WS project  Azure provider creates a Fabric capacity Fabric Provider creates/performs the following: Workspace Assign WS to capacity Provision Workspace identity Connection to ADLS Gen2 \- Credentials  "WS Identity" Roles assigned to WS Shortcut (Connection ID to ADLS Gen2) Lakehouse 1 ( include shortcut ) Lakehouse 2 Notebook Copy Job Report Semantic Model A CLI script runs CopyJob to copy data to the Bronze Lakehouse 1, it uses workspace identity as the auth method for credential free data access A CLI script runs a Notebook to transform data from Bronze to Silver Lakehouse | Fabric Capacity, WS and Items are created using the 2 Terraform providers (Azure and fabric) LH data \- copied using Copy Job activated by CLI Data transformation is done by Run Notebook using the CLI | Need to decide what do we show here (medallion arch, 3 WSs?) Meenal Srivastva/ Yulia Turchin to comment how does the identity/Connections/ permissions fit in this step (Soft delete too?) Identity as auth method to get Data (owner: Yulia) create the workspace identity [Workspaces \- Provision Identity \- REST API (Core) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/fabric/core/workspaces/provision-identity?tabs=HTTP) grant the workspace identity with permissions to Azure storage through terraform [azurerm\_role\_assignment | Resources | hashicorp/azurerm | Terraform | Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/role_assignment) create lakehouse shortcut through APIs and use workspace identity as the authentication method to securely bring data in OneLake [OneLake Shortcuts \- Create Shortcut \- REST API (Core) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/fabric/core/onelake-shortcuts/create-shortcut?tabs=HTTP#create-shortcut-adlsgen2-target-example) and [Connections \- Create Connection \- REST API (Core) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/fabric/core/connections/create-connection?tabs=HTTP) Item identity to ensure items don't fail when owner leaves the organization Set SPN or workspace identity as the items identity through APIs (coming in March and July) |
| provisioning validation | use the Fabric MCP to accelerate development with AI assistance Open VS Code with GitHub Copilot enabled Show the Fabric MCP Server extension installed Configure the MCP server to connect to the Fabric workspace Demonstrate AI-assisted queries | Fabric MCP local server reached GA in October 2025, enabling production use with AI agents The hosted server is in public preview for integration with Copilot Studio, enabling enterprise AI agent scenarios MCP enables natural language development – AI agents can reason over your Fabric data and generate production-ready code | Aviv Ezrachireplace MCP with gh-copilot skills |
|  | End state \- Full Project with a workspace and items is up and running, ~~including dev/test/prod WSs~~ |  |  |
