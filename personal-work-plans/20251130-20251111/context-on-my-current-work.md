# **Efforts Overview and Context**

Below is a breakdown of each workstream with relevant background details gathered from recent meetings, emails, and documents. This information will help in planning and prioritizing your next steps:


Dec 10, 2025: ILDC Site Visit – Product Reviews & Team Meetings
Kim Manis (CVP of Product) and Laurent Mollicone (recently promoted CVP in Azure Data) are visiting the ILDC Haifa office. On Dec 10, they will attend a series of Fabric Platform product review sessions (covering CI/CD, Automation & Embed, and Extend), an All-Hands meeting, and a PMs Roundtable with the team. Alon Baram has asked the Haifa team to be on-site that day to meet Kim and Laurent.

Dec 11, 2025: 1:1 “AI Automation, MCP & CLI” Discussion
On Dec 11, you have a 1:1 session with Kim Manis at the Herzliya office (titled “Empowering Our Users with AI-Powered Automation: MCPs and CLI in Fabric”). This 25-minute meeting is your opportunity to brief Kim on your areas – specifically AI-driven automation, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) platform, and the Fabric CLI – and to demo or discuss recent progress in these domains.




## 1. **Preparing for Laurent & Kim’s ILDC Visit (Dec 10–11)**

**Meeting Schedule & Objectives:** Kim and Laurent’s visit centers on back-to-back meetings with the ILDC Fabric Platform team. On **Dec 10**, they will join three **Product Review** sessions (CI/CD, Automation & Embed, and Extend), each \~55 minutes, followed by a Fabric Platform **All-Hands** and a **PM Roundtable**. These sessions are meant to showcase the team’s progress and get leadership feedback. Alon’s email confirms Kim and Laurent will be in Haifa that day. Each Product Review has a specific focus area: for example, the **“Automation & Embed Product Review”** (Dec 10, 10:35–11:30) likely covers your domain (automation tooling, CLI, embedding scenarios). The team has been planning content for these reviews – an internal prep document outlines key points to cover, including **usage metrics and customer feedback**, recent feature work (e.g. batch import/export APIs, the new **Remote MCP** service, the “unified creator” Copilot agent), and demos. In particular, the agenda shows emphasis on **AI-powered automation** (MCPs) and **CLI** alongside embedding, which aligns with your areas.

**1:1 with Kim (Topics to Cover):** In addition to the group sessions, you have a one-on-one meeting with **Kim Manis** on Dec 11 to dive deeper into **AI & automation initiatives**. You proactively ensured this meeting was scheduled – in chats with Kim’s coordinator, you requested 30 minutes during her ILDC trip to discuss **Fabric MCPs and Fabric CLI** with her. Kim’s schedule was coordinated through an ILDC contact (Sharon) and her administrator, and ultimately you were added to an existing meeting slot focused on **MCP and CLI in Fabric**. The **goal of this 1:1** is to brief Kim on how your team is leveraging AI for automation in Fabric. Specifically, you should be prepared to present: the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** platform – what it enables, recent customer validation findings – and the **Fabric CLI**, including its new capabilities and how it ties into automation. Kim will expect to hear how these efforts drive productivity and automation for Fabric: for example, how the **MCP servers** allow AI agents to execute tasks, and how the **CLI (including the upcoming in-portal CLI)** can empower advanced users or integrate with Copilot. In the internal prep notes for Kim’s visit, the team highlighted these exact points (MCP, CLI, AI automation) as important discussion topics. Make sure to illustrate with concrete examples or demos if possible (e.g. a short demo of an AI-driven task using MCP/CLI). Kim is “constantly impressed by the impact of the team” and is looking forward to updates, so this is a chance to shine a spotlight on your work.

**Context from Leadership:** During internal prep, some debate emerged about the value of interactive CLI in the Fabric portal (see Effort 6 below), but leadership ultimately agreed to pursue it and validate its impact. By the time of Kim’s visit, the team will have a coherent story: they plan to show that **AI-powered automation** (via MCP) and **CLI tooling** are delivering value. You should be ready to summarize: current status (e.g. Fabric CLI usage, MCP private preview adoption), near-term roadmap (e.g. the upcoming **hosted Remote MCP service** in Fabric), and how these pieces come together to enable scenarios like automated workspace management. Kim may ask about real customer use cases or feedback, so leveraging any data from your recent customer calls (or the Partner Voice session) could be useful. Overall, the expectation is that by the end of these sessions, Kim and Laurent clearly understand the progress and vision for automation in Fabric (both near-term and future with AI/Copilot integration). They will likely provide feedback or direction that can inform your next steps.

*(**Note:** Laurent Mollicone, as a CVP in Azure Data, will also be keen on these discussions – in a recent execution review he asked detailed questions about local vs. remote MCP capabilities.

## 2. **Validating “CLI in the Web” with Avishag & Rivka (Customer Research)**

You are collaborating with **Avishag Spillinger** and **Rivka Moshe** from the UX research team on a validation study for the **Fabric CLI in the web portal** (the “CLI New Experience”). The goal is to gather customer input on how users might use a built-in CLI and what pain points or needs they have. Avishag and Rivka have prepared research materials – including a **Study Guide** with key objectives and interview questions – which you have been reviewing. On November 25, researcher **Jeremy Hoover** circulated an updated draft of the CLI study guide, mentioning he reworked the key objectives and tagged you, Avishag, and Rivka for feedback. The study will recruit **10 participants** (5 **pro developers** who already use the Fabric CLI locally, and 5 **“citizen developer”** Fabric users with some CLI familiarity). Sessions will be **45–60 minutes** via Teams in early December. The researchers plan to use a **“live build” exploratory approach** – meaning if a prototype or CLI console is available in a test environment, they’ll let users try it, or otherwise walk through scenarios. [\[Jeremy Hoo...perience". | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEMAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAE4KkbtAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem) [\[Jeremy Hoo...perience". | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEMAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAE4KkbpAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)

**Focus of Interviews:** The study’s interview questions are designed to understand user habits and preferences around command-line vs UI. For example, they will ask: *“How do you usually accomplish tasks in Fabric – do you stick to the UI or use tools like Copilot or scripts?”*, *“What challenges have you faced using CLI tools (e.g. finding the right commands, syntax, error handling)?”*, and *“Are there certain tasks you feel are better NOT done via CLI? Why?”*. For less technical users, they’ll probe comfort level: *“Have you used a CLI in your work? If not, what are your reasons or concerns?”*. They also want to identify any gaps: *“What’s missing from CLI tools that forces you back to the UI?”*. Essentially, this research will validate the **user need for a web-based CLI** and inform which features or onboarding support it requires. [\[Jeremy Hoo...perience". | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEMAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAE4KkboAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)

**Your Role:** You have already contributed by adding some research questions and making sure the study captures hypotheses you care about. For instance, one hypothesis is that having a CLI in the web could benefit power users for automation, but might intimidate casual users – the study will test this. You shared with Avishag your initial thoughts and ensured the discussion covers both personas (pro dev and citizen dev). Now, your next step is to **provide input on what to prioritize in the customer interviews**. Based on internal discussions, a critical area to validate is the value of an **integrated CLI vs. relying on Copilot**. In the team meeting, you voiced concern that a CLI in the web might be a “solution looking for a problem” unless we identify concrete use cases. Aviv and Alon encouraged you to validate specific **user scenarios**: for example, *would a Fabric user want to open a terminal in the portal to execute bulk actions, and in what cases?*. They suggested formulating **hypotheses** (e.g. “Some Fabric admins will prefer writing a script for repetitive tasks because it’s more deterministic or can be saved and rerun”) and then asking customers to react. [\[Re: Resear...earch Lab\] | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEJAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAD%2bWRmbAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem) [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15}) [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15}), [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15})

Given this, you should ensure the research sessions explicitly cover scenarios like: *“If Fabric provided a built-in CLI console, how might you use it? For troubleshooting? Bulk changes?”* and *“If Copilot can generate scripts for you, would you still find a CLI useful?”*. In fact, one planned question (as per Jeremy’s guide) is asking users to imagine they have a CLI in Fabric and what they’d do with it. Make sure to emphasize to Avishag/Rivka which insights are most actionable for your decision: for instance, **gauging interest in automation scripts vs. interactive exploration**. [\[Jeremy Hoo...perience". | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEMAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAE4KkboAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)

**Materials & Next Steps:** The study guide “CLI New Experience” document is the primary material – Jeremy tagged you in comments about assumptions (he noted the guide assumes the user already uses CLI, and suggests also covering those who don’t). You should review the latest version and **provide any modifications by early this week** so the team can finalize the interview script. The research sessions are likely scheduled for the second week of December. Shortly after, there will be a readout of findings. These findings will directly influence the vision document you are writing for CLI in web (Effort 6) and decisions on whether to proceed. In summary, this effort provides **data to back (or challenge) your plans**. Make sure to attend at least some sessions or debriefs if possible – hearing direct partner feedback on CLI usability will be invaluable when you pitch the next steps to management. [\[Jeremy Hoo...perience". | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEMAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAE4KkboAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)

*(For context, this study is part of the broader **“SWIFT Research Lab”** efforts on Fabric usability. It’s similar to past studies on Fabric features (e.g. a recent Policies UX study). The outcomes will likely be documented and possibly shared in a research summary or podcast. Keep an eye out for the final report.)* [\[Re: Resear...earch Lab\] | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEJAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAD%2bWRmbAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)

## 3. **Partner Voice Program – Customer Presentation (Tue, Dec 2)**

You have a **Partner Voice** webcast scheduled for Tuesday, Dec 2, where you will present to Microsoft Fabric partners and MVPs. This is part of the **Fabric Partner Voice Advisory Program** (which regularly hosts webcasts and roundtables for partners). According to logistics emails from the program manager (Stephanie Chimeziri), your session is confirmed for **Dec 2, 8–9 AM Pacific Time**. This slots conveniently on your Tuesday evening (since you’re UTC+2). The session is described as a **“Partner Voice Webcast”** focusing on **Fabric CLI & Automation Scenarios**. In fact, the email thread’s subject is “Fabric MCP, CLI & Automation Scenarios,” indicating that your talk will cover how partners can use the Fabric CLI and Model Context Protocol for automation. [\[RE: Fabric...Scenarios | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEMAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAEyn%2bvLAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)

**Content & Audience:** This presentation is essentially a **customer-facing version** of the work you’re doing – expect an audience of **Fabric partners, ISVs, and perhaps some MVPs** who are part of the advisory program. Your goal is to educate them on new capabilities (like the Fabric CLI, local/hosted MCP servers) and demonstrate **use cases** that would matter to them. For example, you might show how an MCP-powered script can automate tenant governance, or how the CLI can be used in CI/CD pipelines – anything that helps partners better build solutions on Fabric. It’s also an opportunity to collect feedback or interest from these early adopters.

Stephanie’s email suggests that originally they planned “roundtable” follow-ups; indeed, she asked if you could do interactive roundtable sessions on Dec 9 and 11, but you indicated those dates conflict with Kim’s visit and suggested the week of Dec 15 instead. Ultimately, they agreed to schedule two **Roundtables on Dec 16 and 18** from 8–9 AM PT for deeper discussion. **In the webcast on Dec 2, announce these upcoming roundtables**. The format on Dec 2 will be mostly presentation (webinar style), whereas the roundtables will be smaller, discussion-driven meetings with selected partner participants. [\[RE: Fabric...Scenarios | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEMAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAEyn%2bvLAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)

**Preparation:** By now, you should have the **slide deck and demo** ready. It sounds like you’ve been coordinating with Stephanie and possibly Ted Pattison (who was CC’d as a stakeholder). Ted confirmed he’s available for Dec 9/11 originally, and noted the Dec 2 session is “for Hasan” (you), indicating he might not be speaking in that one. So, you are the primary presenter on Dec 2. The program manager asked if you’ve filled out the **participation form and screening questions** for the roundtables. This means you need to define what kind of partner personas you want in those interactive sessions (e.g. “partners who have tried Fabric CLI” or “partners interested in automation”). Ensure you complete that form so they can recruit attendees – likely you’ve done this by now, but double-check with Stephanie if not. [\[RE: Fabric...Scenarios | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEMAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAEyn%2bvLAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)

As for content, the **key points to cover** will include:

*   **Fabric CLI** status: introduction of the CLI (if some partners aren’t aware), what it can do today (cover basic commands, script examples), and roadmap (e.g. upcoming in-portal CLI – though that’s early, you might hint at future directions).
*   **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: explain what the Fabric MCP server is and how it enables AI automation. Many partners may not be familiar with MCP yet, so describe it plainly (it’s a way for AI or scripts to call Fabric APIs in natural language or with code generation). Highlight that **Fabric’s MCP preview** is available and what scenarios it unlocks (e.g. building Copilot-like agents, automating tasks like provisioning workspaces). [\[Developing...to CLI/MCP | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEMAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAEJ6b04AAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem), [\[Developing...to CLI/MCP | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEMAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAEJ6b04AAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)
*   **Automation Scenarios & Demos:** This will be the most engaging part – show a concrete scenario. For instance, demonstrate an **end-to-end scenario**: use the CLI to export some Fabric artifact, or run a script that onboards a new workspace with certain settings. If possible, incorporate the **MCP agent**: e.g. show how an AI agent (via MCP) could generate a script, which you then run in CLI. One suggestion is the scenario you described in our conversation: “**renaming all my workspaces according to a naming convention**.” You could outline how doing that manually is tedious, but with an AI + CLI approach: the Copilot (or you) writes a CLI script to batch rename, then executes it via the MCP – achieving in seconds what would take a user hours. This story would resonate with partners who manage large Fabric deployments.

**Expected Feedback:** Partners on the call may ask questions or give feedback. They might be interested in when certain features will be available (for example, if the **Hosted/Remote MCP** is not publicly available yet, be ready to clarify timeline – likely Private Preview now, Public Preview in March as per your spec). They might also share their own scenarios: e.g. “Can the Fabric CLI integrate with our CI/CD pipeline?” or “We’d love an easier way to manage capacities via script – is that planned?”. Try to capture these inputs. Stephanie or the Partner Voice team often records these sessions and may send you a **monthly update**; indeed, there are monthly Partner Voice newsletters (you can see Partner Voice Monthly Update emails in your inbox). Your session will likely be mentioned in the November or December update.

After the webcast, the next step is the **roundtables** (Dec 16 & 18). Those will be smaller (maybe \~10 partners each) and more interactive. By then, you should have specific discussion questions ready (Stephanie asked for “3-4 questions to send participants in advance” for each roundtable). Those questions can be about what automation use cases partners have, feedback on CLI usability, etc. We’ll handle that preparation after the webcast. For now, focus on delivering a clear, value-focused presentation on Dec 2. This effort not only informs partners but also gives you external feedback just ahead of planning the next semester – which is perfect timing.

*(As side notes: The **Enterprise Voice** program is parallel to Partner Voice, targeting enterprise customers. You’ve interacted with both – e.g. you requested an Enterprise Voice webcast for Feb 27. The content may overlap. Also, the program manager for Partner Voice, Stephanie (an external consultant, note her email v-schimeziri), has been coordinating these sessions closely with you and Ted. She explicitly separated your Partner Voice webcast from the roundtables in communications, so each has a distinct purpose. The Dec 2 webcast is more one-to-many communication, whereas the roundtables are feedback forums. Be aware of that distinction in your preparation.)* [\[Re: Enterp...ruary 2025 | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEJAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAB3zV%2bLAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem) [\[RE: Fabric...Scenarios | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEMAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAEyn%2bvLAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)

## 4. **Local & Remote MCP Specs – Reviews on Tue/Wed**

You have prepared detailed **Product Specs** for the Fabric MCP servers – both the **Local MCP server** (runs on a user’s machine or in VS Code) and the **Hosted “Remote” MCP server** (runs as a service in Fabric). Now you need to conduct spec review meetings to get final feedback and buy-in. In chat, you mentioned *“I scheduled spec reviews next week for local and remote MCPs.”*. Those are likely set for Tuesday and Wednesday (the coming ones). In fact, you attempted initial reviews earlier in November (there were calendar invites on Nov 9 for “Local MCP Spec Review” and “Remote MCP Spec Review”), but it seems you are doing a second round now to iterate on the latest spec drafts (perhaps after incorporating feedback). [\[Hasan Abo...ly in chat | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:034c6f8a-6cce-436d-88ff-be303a6df4b0_1135d11b-8a63-4009-a115-30cede516983@unq.gbl.spaces/1764242537841?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D) [\[Local MCP...pec Review | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAEn3P44AAA%3d)

**Spec Content & Status:** The **Fabric Hosted MCP Server Spec** is on version 6.0 (as of Nov 20) and marked “Ready for Review”. You are the document owner and Mahir Diab is the tech lead. The spec outlines the vision, requirements, and timeline for enabling a hosted MCP service in Fabric. According to the metadata, the target is **Private Preview (M0) by January 2026** and **Public Preview by March 2026 (FabCon Atlanta)**. The spec likely covers how the Remote MCP will allow AI agents or users to execute Fabric **public API operations** programmatically via natural language or code gen, within Fabric’s security boundaries. It also probably details the **tool catalog** (which Fabric actions will be supported), authentication model, multi-tenant considerations, etc. The **Local MCP spec** (perhaps included or separate) covers the CLI-integrated MCP that runs locally (which was actually already released in private preview around September).

In the November 12 Execution Review meeting, you gave a concise overview of both MCP types:

*   The **Local MCP** (“Fabric Local MCP”) targets pro devs and runs on their machine (e.g. as a package in VS Code). It excels at scenarios where local resources or files need to interact with Fabric. *“For example, if I have local CSV files I want to upload to a Lakehouse, the local MCP can handle that use-case by bridging local data to Fabric APIs.”*. Local MCP leverages the fact it runs with the user’s credentials and can manipulate local context (files, local tools) – analogous to how CLI can do things that pure cloud APIs cannot (like file I/O). We’ve already launched this as part of the open-source Microsoft MCP repo (Fabric MCP is now one of the official MCP servers alongside Azure’s). [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe}), [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe}) [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe})
*   The **Remote (Hosted) MCP** is a Fabric service that allows secure execution of tasks entirely in the cloud. It focuses mainly on **control-plane operations via Fabric’s public REST APIs**. Essentially, this will enable agentic automation scenarios without needing a user’s machine – for example, an AI agent running in the cloud that can create workspaces, adjust capacities, or orchestrate Fabric artifacts by calling APIs on the user’s behalf. This is the component slated for preview by FabCon. In the meeting, you described this as *“hosted MCP within Fabric that enables execution of public APIs, mainly control-plane”*. One key distinction: remote MCP can’t directly access local files, but it can scale and run in background – good for fully automated workflows. Laurent asked if everything the local MCP does could be done via remote; you explained not entirely, due to local-specific abilities (like file access), but noted there will be some shared components (common API knowledge, etc.). [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe}), [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe}) [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe})

**Review Meeting Focus:** In the upcoming spec reviews, expect the audience to be your **platform team leads and possibly related stakeholders** (e.g. architects like Gena Vorobyov, and PMs like Aviv Yahav – both are listed as reviewers in the spec metadata). They will examine if the spec’s requirements are sound and if anything is missing. Topics likely to come up: [\[MCPs MD Files | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEMAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAExDbMRAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)

*   **Security & Governance:** How will the hosted MCP ensure it executes commands safely within a tenant’s permissions? (This was a major point from customer feedback: *“customers need MCP to respect scopes, roles, and security boundaries”*). You should confirm the spec covers authentication (it does – you’re providing auth and telemetry infrastructure for all MCPs) and governance (perhaps an admin can enable/disable agentic execution). [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe})
*   **Unified Entry Point:** There’s a known long-term vision to have a **single unified MCP endpoint** for customers, even though internally there might be multiple MCP servers. In the Execution Review, you mentioned the eventual goal of a *“unified MCP server or item”* that could route to various tools. Laurent found the idea of making an MCP server a first-class **Fabric item** intriguing. Ensure the spec addresses (or at least acknowledges) how we’ll evolve toward that unified model, even if not in v1. [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe}), [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe}) [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe})
*   **Extensibility for Workloads:** This ties into Effort 5 (the wiki/guidance for other teams). The spec should explain how other Fabric teams can plug their tools or create their own MCP “modules.” For example, the Power BI team is building a “Datamart Copilot” MCP separately – are we providing a common framework? In the meeting, Aviv noted we are coordinating so that everyone uses the same auth flows and standards. Your spec likely includes a section on enabling **workload-specific MCP tools** (maybe called “Tool Catalog & Capabilities” in the ToC). Be prepared to show how the platform will support teams adding new commands to the hosted MCP (with minimal work). [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe}) [\[MCPs MD Files | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEMAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAExDbMRAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)
*   **Timeline & Milestones:** The spec has a timeline table. Ensure everyone agrees it’s realistic. M0 in Jan (probably internal preview) is aggressive – highlight what minimal set is targeted (perhaps basic workspace and capacity operations?). M1 in March (Public Preview) will be a big external milestone, likely announced at Fabric conference, so meeting that is important. Any concerns about that should be raised now. [\[MCPs MD Files | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEMAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAExDbMRAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)
*   **Open Questions:** If there are any TBDs in the spec (like “decision needed on how to handle long-running operations or throttling”), bring them up. For instance, **throttling and rate limits** for agentic use came up with Justyna’s team – Laurent asked if we are addressing it. Tal and Yifat discussed how we alert on errors and reliability, which tangentially touches MCP if it calls many APIs. Make sure to mention how the spec accounts for not overloading the system (maybe by using existing API quotas and having safeguards). [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe}) [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe}), [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe})

After these reviews, you should incorporate any feedback and then the spec will be essentially final. Given it’s “Ready for Review” at v6.0, you’re very close. These sessions are crucial to get everyone (PM, dev, architect leads) on the same page before implementation proceeds in earnest. [\[MCPs MD Files | Outlook\]](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/?ItemID=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4%2fdvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAAAAAEMAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI%2bAAExDbMRAAA%3d\&exvsurl=1\&viewmodel=ReadMessageItem)

**Outcome:** Expect clear approval or minor direction changes. For example, they might approve proceeding with Private Preview for hosted MCP. They might also formalize priorities: e.g. “Focus on control-plane tasks first; things like executing user queries might be out-of-scope for now,” depending on the feedback. Document any such decisions in the spec revision history (v7.0 will reflect the review outcomes).

In summary, come to the meetings with the spec document sent out in advance (if you haven’t, do so ASAP) and be ready to walk through its key sections. Emphasize how **Local MCP and Remote MCP** complement each other and how this fits into the **AI automation strategy** of Fabric. The better everyone understands the plan now, the smoother it will be to deliver it on the tight timeline.

## 5. **Internal Wiki for Fabric MCP Platform (Workload Onboarding)**

As part of making the MCP platform usable by other teams (and eventually external users), you are creating an **internal wiki or guidance document**. This wiki will explain **how Fabric workloads (e.g. Power BI, Data Engineering teams)** can onboard to the MCP platform – whether by adding their tools to the hosted MCP or even creating their own “Unified Copilot” agents using MCP. In the Nov 12 review, you mentioned the third aspect of your MCP work is *“enabling workloads to add their own MCPs or tools”*, and that you are *“now building the process to allow teams to add their tools… providing auth, hosting, telemetry, etc.”*. The internal wiki is essentially the **implementation of that process documentation**. [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe})

**Scope of the Wiki:** It will likely include:

*   **Overview for Workload Teams:** Explanation of what MCP is and the benefits of integrating their feature into it. (E.g. “If your team has an AI/automation scenario, you can expose it via the Fabric MCP platform so it’s accessible to Copilots and scripts.”)
*   **How to Contribute a Tool:** Step-by-step on how a dev team can add a new “action” or tool to the MCP tool catalog. For example, if the SQL team wants an MCP tool for running T-SQL queries, how would they define it? This likely involves writing some code (perhaps in the MCP repository) and following certain schemas. The wiki should outline that process (likely referencing the **GitHub MCP repo** where they’d submit their tool code).
*   **Testing & Security:** Guidelines on how to test their MCP module and ensure it meets security/privacy standards. This could include code review requirements, similar to how any new public API goes through API review boards. Here is where your question arises: *should we manage it as strictly as we do APIs or just give guidance?* Currently, Fabric public APIs have a rigorous review pipeline for compliance. Applying the same to every MCP tool might slow things down. The **open question** you have is whether each new MCP tool needs formal approval by the platform team or if teams can add tools more freely under a governance model. You will likely seek input from Alon and Aviv on this. They might lean towards a middle ground: provide clear **guidelines/checklists** in the wiki (covering logging, security, performance), and **require sign-off only for high-risk tools**. The prep meeting notes for Kim’s visit even listed **“Onboarding Wiki”** as an item to be shared – indicating management expects a documented process rather than ad-hoc contributions. [\[PMEng... D...2025-11-26 | Loop\]](https://loop.cloud.microsoft/p/eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9taWNyb3NvZnRldXItbXkuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vcGVyc29uYWwvYWxvbmJhX21pY3Jvc29mdF9jb20%2FbmF2PWN6MGxNa1p3WlhKemIyNWhiQ1V5Um1Gc2IyNWlZU1UxUm0xcFkzSnZjMjltZENVMVJtTnZiU1prUFdJbE1qRkhSV0pWVEVWM1JuaFZkVmxKTkVoNVJXcFdUalp5VUdGclVqRmFSbEZPUVhSb1ZUQm9aVUoyTVRWMWNqQXpTMjVPYldzelVqWjFjaVV5UkRoR1preEtOM2NtWmowd01VODNVVlkyU2xNM1RFeE9XVGN6UkVoSFJrSmFWMDR5VWpSVVNUTkdSVUZISm1NOUpUSkcifQ%3D%3D)
*   **Operating Model:** How these tools are maintained and versioned. (E.g. if a team updates their tool, how to deploy those changes? The platform team might own deployment in the hosted service.)
*   **Examples and Templates:** Possibly include an example of a simple MCP tool (maybe a template for a “Hello World” action or a real example like the recently developed **Power BI (RTI) MCP server** that one team did). Showing a concrete example will help other teams follow suit.

**Collaboration and Feedback:** The wiki will be shared internally with relevant engineering teams and your managers for feedback **before** wider distribution. You plan to circulate it to **Alon** (your manager) and **Aviv Ezrachi** (your skip-level manager) and others for input. They will consider how much freedom to grant teams. In the Nov 27 PM discussion, Aviv strongly advocated involving customers/users in validating any shift in strategy, but when it comes to internal processes, he likely wants consistency and quality. It’s a safe bet he will want the platform team (you and colleagues) to keep an eye on what gets added, at least initially. So in the wiki, you might include a note that *“Additions of new MCP capabilities should be reviewed by the Fabric Platform team to ensure coherence and avoid duplication”*. However, also ensure the wiki doesn’t create too high a barrier – the goal is to encourage teams to leverage MCP rather than building siloed agents. Emphasize how the platform team will support them (with authentication, telemetry, etc. already handled). [\[Fabric Aut...Recording | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/avive_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={c8251859-aea0-456c-8484-3587352551fe}) [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15}), [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15})

**Related Data Points:** From customer/partner feedback, we know there is interest in multiple MCP servers. For example, at FabCon Europe, some talked about a Power BI-specific MCP and an RTI (Real-Time Intelligence) MCP. Your platform aims to unify these so they aren’t completely separate. The wiki should clarify how teams can either integrate into the single Fabric MCP Service or, if they must build separate, how to align with standards. In the Execution Review, Laurent asked if we have an inventory of all MCP efforts across Fabric. This implies part of your work is also **cataloguing existing MCP implementations** (like RTI’s local MCP, PBI’s efforts, etc.) and making sure they converge. The wiki might include a section listing current official MCP servers (Fabric Local MCP, Fabric Hosted MCP, PowerBI’s agent if any, etc.) to set context for readers.

**Timeline:** You likely want to publish this internal wiki about the same time the hosted MCP enters preview (so internal teams can start using it). Since that preview is Jan 2026, finishing the wiki in December is ideal. In the Kim visit prep, “Onboarding Wiki” was on the agenda to perhaps mention as a done item – suggesting you plan to finalize it very soon and maybe get Kim’s acknowledgement that we have a process in place. [\[PMEng... D...2025-11-26 | Loop\]](https://loop.cloud.microsoft/p/eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9taWNyb3NvZnRldXItbXkuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vcGVyc29uYWwvYWxvbmJhX21pY3Jvc29mdF9jb20%2FbmF2PWN6MGxNa1p3WlhKemIyNWhiQ1V5Um1Gc2IyNWlZU1UxUm0xcFkzSnZjMjltZENVMVJtTnZiU1prUFdJbE1qRkhSV0pWVEVWM1JuaFZkVmxKTkVoNVJXcFdUalp5VUdGclVqRmFSbEZPUVhSb1ZUQm9aVUoyTVRWMWNqQXpTMjVPYldzelVqWjFjaVV5UkRoR1preEtOM2NtWmowd01VODNVVlkyU2xNM1RFeE9XVGN6UkVoSFJrSmFWMDR5VWpSVVNUTkdSVUZISm1NOUpUSkcifQ%3D%3D)

**Next Steps:** After incorporating feedback from Alon, Aviv, and engineering leads (like Mahir or others) on the wiki, you will publish it on an appropriate internal site (possibly the Fabric Engineering Wiki or SharePoint). You might also hold a short info session with workload teams to walk them through it. This documentation will feed into external documentation eventually, but for now it’s internal. Keep note of any contentious points (e.g. **whether MCP contributions require CL approval** similar to API changes) and get a resolution from management to document clearly. The outcome should be a clear set of **do’s and don’ts** for teams by the time the MCP platform is in use.

In summary, Effort 5 is about **formalizing the process for others to extend the MCP platform**. By doing so, you ensure consistency and help scale the platform’s adoption. This directly supports the Automation & Copilot vision, because the more teams contribute their commands (instead of making isolated copilots), the more powerful the unified Fabric Copilot can become.

## 6. **“CLI in Web” Vision Document (Integration of CLI & MCP for Automation)**

You are formulating a strategic **vision document** for bringing the Fabric CLI experience into the Fabric web portal and integrating it with the MCP (Model Context Protocol) and Copilot efforts. This document will outline your long-term vision and near-term plan for a **web-based CLI** and its interplay with AI automation. It’s essentially a proposal you will present to leadership (and use to coordinate with engineering) after getting initial research (Effort 2) and leadership feedback.

**Background – Internal Discussion:** In the Nov 27 product discussion, you, Alon, and Aviv had an in-depth debate about the merits and approach of a CLI in the web interface. Initially, you expressed concern that simply embedding a terminal might not solve a real user need (“a solution looking for a problem” as you said bluntly). Aviv challenged you to *prove whether it’s a needed solution* by hypothesizing use cases and validating them with users. Through a spirited conversation, the team aligned on a broader **vision: an integrated experience where Copilot and CLI work together** to empower both less-technical and power users. The outcome was essentially a directive for you to “rethink and articulate the vision,” then validate it. As Aviv said, *“write your use cases and hypotheses, talk to customers, gather feedback, and then we can adjust course”*. He and Alon did **NOT** shut down the idea – instead, they see potential if framed correctly. [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15}), [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15}) [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15})

**Vision Highlights:** From that meeting (and your own ideas), the emerging vision is:

*   **In-Portal CLI Shell:** Fabric should offer an interactive CLI console within the web UI (perhaps a toggleable panel or special mode). This gives advanced users direct control for automation and scripting without leaving the browser. It could be similar to how Azure portal offers a Cloud Shell. This addresses scenarios where a user wants to perform batch operations or use commands for things not easily done via clicking (e.g. renaming 100 workspaces, mass permissions changes).
*   **Integration with Copilot (AI Agent):** The real magic is when the CLI and Copilot agent work in tandem. A user could instruct Copilot in natural language, and **Copilot could generate CLI commands** to accomplish the task. This was heavily discussed: *“Imagine you have Copilot in the portal and a CLI console below. You ask Copilot to do something complex – behind the scenes it writes a CLI script and executes it, giving you transparency and repeatability.”*. This hybrid approach leverages Copilot’s ease-of-use and CLI’s precision. In the meeting you noted this would be extremely valuable: seeing Copilot’s suggested CLI script “under the hood” not only ensures trust (user can review the commands) but also provides a reusable artifact (the user can save or tweak the script). [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15}), [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15})
*   **Determinism and Scale:** One insight you had: Copilot’s natural language actions are great for single tasks, but if a user needs to apply an action at scale (hundreds of items), relying on pure AI could be inefficient or error-prone. Having it output a script that can loop or handle bulk operations is more **deterministic** and cost-effective (multiple Copilot requests could incur more compute cost, whereas one generated script can run in one go). You raised the point that **Copilot (GPT)** might not always be ideal for large batches or precise adjustments, and that a CLI can fill that gap. This argument will feature in your vision doc: the CLI-web integration isn’t just duplicating Copilot, it complements it for certain categories of tasks (especially *administration and automation* tasks). [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15}), [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15})
*   **Two-Phase User Validation:** Aviv suggested structuring the validation in two parts: [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15})
    1.  Concept test of *“Would you use an interactive CLI in the portal? For what?”* (This is happening via Effort 2’s research).
    2.  Concept test of *“Would you use a Copilot that writes CLI scripts for you?”* (You might incorporate this into follow-up interviews or roundtables – even the Partner roundtable could be used to ask this). This combined scenario is very appealing as a vision: an end-to-end where a user can escalate from natural language to code seamlessly. Your document should paint this picture clearly.

**Document Content:** Based on internal guidance, the doc should include:

*   **Problem Statement & Opportunity:** Explain the trend – many dev platforms (like Azure, GitHub) provide integrated CLI or “Codespaces”; Fabric currently lacks this. The opportunity is to make automation easier for users *within* Fabric, increasing power-user satisfaction and fostering advanced use cases (like DevOps integration).
*   **User Personas & Use Cases:** Identify who would benefit. For instance:
    *   *Fabric Admins* managing large environments (need to script repetitive tasks).
    *   *Pro Developers* who prefer code over GUI, or want to integrate Fabric actions into pipelines.
    *   *Data Analysts or Citizen Devs* who normally use UI but could occasionally run provided scripts (Copilot can help them generate those scripts – making CLI accessible to non-experts).
        Include concrete examples (renaming workspaces, bulk exporting data, reassigning capacities, etc., as we’ve discussed).
*   **Vision for Integrated Experience:** Describe the future state: the Fabric portal has a **CLI panel** and Copilot can operate in two modes (direct execution or script generation). Perhaps show a mock-up if available. Emphasize the *transparency and repeatability* benefit: *“Copilot writes the CLI commands for you, you see them, and can run them now or save for later”*. [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15}), [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15})
*   **Milestones Plan:** Likely a phased approach:
    *   Phase 1: Basic CLI shell in portal (no AI integration yet) – perhaps as an experimental feature for power users. This could be targeted for **Semester H1 2026** if decided.
    *   Phase 2: Copilot integration – e.g. Copilot can output CLI scripts. This might need MCP remote execution fully in place (since Copilot would call MCP to run the commands). Possibly align with the hosted MCP GA (\~Build 2026 or later).
    *   Phase 3: Deeper enhancements (like linking CLI outputs to UI, etc.).
*   **Open Questions/Risks:** Address potential concerns:
    *   *“If Copilot does everything in natural language, will anyone use CLI?”* – Your argument: Yes, for determinism, cost, and preference reasons (some users just trust scripts more, plus scripts can be version-controlled which NL queries cannot). Additionally, as Aviv probed, even with a great Copilot, not everyone will always use it for every action. Provide examples where CLI is still useful. [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15}), [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15})
    *   *Overlap with other tools:* Ensure this doesn’t conflict with, say, the existing PowerShell module or external CLI. Actually, it complements – the same Fabric CLI can run in web or locally.
    *   *Engineering complexity:* Taking this on means portal integration and possibly sandboxing (to safely run commands in the browser). Mention if you need to collaborate with the Fabric UX team (likely yes, for UI design of the console) and any platform work (like ensuring the CLI can run via web endpoints).

**Why this Matters (Leadership Perspective):** Kim and others will ask “why invest in this?”. The vision doc should convey:

*   It *drives advanced adoption* – companies with complex needs will see Fabric as customizable and automation-friendly (a big selling point in enterprise environments).
*   It *closes a gap* for pro developers – currently they might say “I have to switch to my local environment to run scripts; why not stay in one place.”
*   It *leverages our MCP investment* – essentially, the hosted MCP becomes even more useful when there is a built-in client (the web CLI) and Copilot generating calls for it. It’s an amplifier for all the work on MCP and automation.

**Next Steps:** You aim to have a draft of this vision doc ready shortly after gathering the Partner Voice and user research feedback (so mid-December). Aviv explicitly told you to *“put your thoughts in writing (‘מסמך’ – a document of vision/hypotheses) and share with us”*. In the meeting you agreed to do so. That is exactly this task. Once the document is written, you will circulate it to Alon, Aviv, and likely others like the engineering lead (Chen/Mahir) for input. This could lead to a decision in January on whether to officially pursue “CLI in Fabric” in the next semester’s plan. [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15})

Keep in mind, the outcome doesn’t need to be binary (do it or not). It could be scope-adjusted: for example, leadership might say “Yes, but only if tightly integrated with Copilot (AI angle) – not as a standalone terminal.” The discussion you had leans that way: to maximize impact by combining CLI + AI, rather than shipping a plain terminal that few might discover or use. So be sure the vision doc reflects an **integrated strategy, not a standalone CLI**. [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15}), [\[PM Review...Transcript | Video\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/viewer.aspx?sourcedoc={5c82ba97-003e-40df-9e56-dddab2223e15})

**Conclusion:** This vision document is your chance to synthesize all the above. It should incorporate:

*   Findings from the customer research (Effort 2) once available – for instance, if many users said they would find value in a web CLI for automation, that’s strong evidence.
*   Feedback from partner sessions – e.g. if at the Dec 16 roundtable a partner says “I wish Fabric had a PowerShell in the browser like Azure does,” you’ll want to quote that.
*   Feasibility input from engineering – ensure the plan is grounded enough to be credible.

All in all, this effort (#6) will set direction for a major potential feature. By doing the homework now (research, partner feedback, internal brainstorming), you are de-risking it and providing a compelling, user-backed proposal. This also feeds back into Kim’s 1:1: if she asks *“Where do we go next with CLI and automation?”*, you can articulate this vision at a high level, showing proactive planning.

***

**Next Steps After Context:** With all the above context gathered for each workstream, we can move on to prioritizing and scheduling your work. Clearly, some tasks have hard dates (the Partner Voice on Dec 2, spec reviews this week, Kim’s visit on Dec 10-11), so those will take immediate priority. Others, like the vision doc, depend on inputs from the earlier tasks. We will use this context to create a coherent action plan and timeline in our next discussion. For now, this information equips you with the background and facts needed to proceed on each front confidently.

### Sunday, Nov 30, 2025

**09:00 – AAIC (Internal AI Community Meeting)**  
**Participants:** Hasan (you) as organizer; open invitation (ILDC colleagues interested in AI).  
**Objective:** Weekly knowledge-sharing session of the “AAIC” group (an internal AI community). These meetings are informal forums for discussing AI topics. (“AAIC” likely stands for an internal AI/ML club or initiative; there are regular “Weekly Zoom” and “Open Lecture” sessions under this name in your calendar.)  
**Context:** You established this community to foster AI learning and collaboration. Previous sessions have included talks and open discussions. This morning’s slot is likely a casual meet-up or planning discussion (no specific agenda or speaker listed).  
**Preparation:** No special prep needed beyond being ready to facilitate conversation. As organizer, come with a topic or prompt in case attendees need guidance. You might recap any recent AI news or tie in to the upcoming Open Lecture tomorrow. (For example, remind everyone about the GPT lecture on Monday.)  
**Relevant History:** Turnout varies, and some meetings have low engagement (“Nobody has accepted the invite” is shown, meaning it’s a standing appointment). Still, you continue these to maintain momentum. Keep it light and optional for colleagues. [\[AAIC | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwFRAAgI3i_jZ8AAAEYAAAAA6D9Em6wj90u1h5WM2_P3bwcA_5YkQF6ffUGaHc1jeoQyPgAAAAABDQAA_5YkQF6ffUGaHc1jeoQyPgAA99Zu6gAAEA%3d%3d)

**10:05 – “CLI Content Improvements” (Call with Jeremy Hoover)**  
**Participants:** Jeremy Hoover (organizer – content designer for Fabric), you (tentative accepted).  
**Objective:** Brainstorm and plan improvements to Fabric CLI documentation and in-product text (error messages, help content, etc.). Jeremy has been auditing the current CLI content and wants your input on proposed changes.  
**Context:** Last week, Jeremy messaged you that he’s reviewing the CLI site and considering new pages, sections, examples, and better error/help experiences. You responded enthusiastically and suggested a quick call. Jeremy scheduled this 25-minute Teams meeting (initially aiming for Thu Nov 27, but it landed on Nov 30, possibly due to rescheduling). He’s prepared ideas to discuss, likely including: improving the CLI help output, refining terminology, adding how-to guides, and ensuring consistency in error messages.  
**Preparation:** Review any notes or drafts Jeremy may have shared. (Check if he sent a document ahead of time – none is explicitly referenced, but the study guide for CLI in web lists Jeremy as a contact, indicating he’s involved in related content.) Be ready to share common pain points users have with CLI docs or errors (e.g. confusing messages you’ve seen reported). Think about top tasks where better examples or walkthroughs in the docs would help (for instance, setting up CI/CD with the CLI, or using new commands like `fab import/export`). Jeremy will appreciate specific feedback.  
**Relevant History:** The CLI went GA in May and “thousands of developers” have tried it. Feedback has surfaced areas to improve content. For example, adding a global filtering parameter and more examples is on the roadmap. In this call, align with Jeremy on quick wins (like updating error phrasing or adding an FAQ) and longer-term content plans.

**11:00 – \[Focus] Review CLI-in-Web Customer Validation Plan**  
**Participants:** *Solo work (focus time).*  
**Objective:** Go through the draft **Study Guide – “CLI New Experience”** (prepared by Avishag Spillinger and team) and the participant screener, and add your feedback/comments. This is prep for the 3:05 PM meeting with Avishag and Rivka to finalize these documents.  
**Context:** The UX research team (Avishag, Rivka, Jeremy) has a plan to test a Fabric CLI integrated in the web UI. They need your PM perspective. In a prior meeting (Nov 25), tasks were assigned: you and Rivka to review the study guide & screener, Jeremy to adjust terminology (like avoiding the phrase “command-line tools”), and Avishag to tweak participant criteria. Avishag has highlighted sections where your input is needed (questions for pro dev vs. citizen developer, etc.).  
**Preparation:** Focus on the **key objectives and questions** in the study guide. Ensure they align with what you want to learn (e.g. do users find value in an integrated CLI? in what scenarios?). Pay attention to the participant criteria: Avishag wants only users with basic CLI familiarity, and decided to **remove any irrelevant criteria like org size**. Verify the screener includes questions about CLI experience to filter out those completely unfamiliar. Also check terminology (e.g. use “Fabric CLI” consistently rather than generic terms). If you see any missing question – for instance, asking if they’ve tried using Copilot for tasks vs CLI – note it down. By the end of this focus time, your comments should be in the documents so that the afternoon meeting can be efficient. *(No need to finalize anything yourself now – just prepare suggestions.)* [\[Study Guid...Experience | Word\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/aspillinger_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B6450A949-48E1-4D43-A8E7-BC728500A51E%7D&file=Study%20Guide%20-%20CLI%20New%20Experience.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1), [\[Study Guid...Experience | Word\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/aspillinger_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B6450A949-48E1-4D43-A8E7-BC728500A51E%7D&file=Study%20Guide%20-%20CLI%20New%20Experience.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) [\[Followup o...I research | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr3AAA%3d) [\[Study Guid...Experience | Word\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/aspillinger_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B6450A949-48E1-4D43-A8E7-BC728500A51E%7D&file=Study%20Guide%20-%20CLI%20New%20Experience.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) [\[Followup o...I research | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr3AAA%3d), [\[Followup o...I research | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr3AAA%3d)

**12:00 – \[Focus] Finalizing MCP Specs**  
**Participants:** *Solo work (focus time).*  
**Objective:** Complete the **Fabric MCP Server spec documents** (both the Hosted “Remote” MCP and the Local MCP spec) in preparation for this week’s review meetings. Ensure they are ready to send out for feedback.  
**Context:** You’ve been iterating on two spec docs: *“Fabric Remote MCP Spec”* (v6.0 ready for review) and *“Fabric Local MCP Spec”*. This block is to wrap up any outstanding sections and compile the latest feedback. By now, you’ve resolved most issues and have clear timelines in the specs (Private Preview in Jan 2026, Public Preview by March 2026 at FabCon). You just need to double-check details and maybe fill in any TBDs. For example, confirm the list of initial API tools each server will support, and the security model description. Past internal discussions give you guidance: ensure the spec addresses **RBAC and audit logging for the hosted MCP** (a major customer concern), and articulates why we need both local and remote MCP. (Recall that when Laurent Mollicone asked “Can’t everything be done by the remote MCP?”, you explained the local MCP is still needed for scenarios like accessing local files or environments.)  
**Preparation:** Go chapter by chapter through each spec. For the **Hosted MCP spec**: verify the “Scope & Requirements” section covers control-plane operations (workspace, capacities, etc.), and the “Open Questions” section has resolution or clear owners. It should note that any Fabric API can be wrapped as a tool, but some long-running operations may need special handling (for instance, check if you called out how to handle large data uploads – likely deferred to local MCP). For the **Local MCP spec**: emphasize how it integrates with the CLI/VS Code and can handle local data. Make sure to mention that **local MCP complements the hosted MCP** by enabling things like file I/O, which the hosted service cannot do (this justifies its ongoing role). Also incorporate any recent feedback from engineering (Mahir’s team might have provided input on telemetry or packaging). By end of this session, you should have both spec documents polished and saved (don’t forget to increment version numbers and add a “Ready for review” note). You will send these out at 3 PM and review them with the team on Dec 2 and 3. [\[Fabric aut...w - Nov 25 | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/tarostok_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B34E16F12-FF64-47AE-99EA-73988068E6E3%7D&file=Fabric%20automation%20and%20embedded%20execution%20review%20-%20Nov%2025.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

**15:05 – “Follow-up on CLI research (finalize documents)”**  
**Participants:** Avishag Spillinger (UX Researcher), Rivka Moshe (Research PM), you (PM), possibly Jeremy Hoover (tentative).  
**Objective:** Final alignment on the **study guide and screener** for the upcoming CLI-in-Web user study. In this 55-minute meeting, the team will resolve any open issues in the research plan and prepare to start recruiting participants.  
**Context:** This is a follow-up to the planning meeting from last week. By now, everyone was to review the draft materials. **Your contributions**: you and Rivka were tasked with adding suggestions to the study guide and participant screener. **Jeremy’s contribution**: updated terminology (ensuring we say “CLI” clearly, etc.). **Avishag’s contribution**: refined participant criteria (requiring basic CLI familiarity, and removing unnecessary filters like company size). She also added a few questions to the screener about CLI experience. In this meeting, Avishag will likely share her screen and walk through the documents section by section to confirm all edits. They’ll want to lock down: the session flow, the exact interview questions, and the recruitment criteria.  
**Key Discussion Points:** [\[Followup o...I research | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr3AAA%3d) [\[Followup o...I research | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr3AAA%3d), [\[Followup o...I research | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr3AAA%3d)

*   **Study Session Flow:** Avishag had outlined an intro, general CLI exploration, then Fabric-specific CLI questions, and finally how CLI and Copilot might intersect. Make sure the flow still makes sense after edits. For example, if you added a question about CLI vs. UI preference, ensure it’s in a logical place. [\[Followup o...I research | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr3AAA%3d)
*   **Two User Personas:** The plan distinguishes between *Pro Developers* and *Citizen Developers* (with some questions tailored to each). Confirm that each persona’s section is coherent and that the questions will surface the insights you need. (E.g. For pro devs: do they script tasks via CLI? For citizens: what would make a CLI less intimidating?) [\[Followup o...I research | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr3AAA%3d)
*   **Terminology and Clarity:** Check that any confusing terms are resolved. For instance, ensure “Fabric CLI” is used instead of just “CLI” when needed, to avoid ambiguity. Also confirm that internal comments meant for moderators are clearly marked (Avishag had blue text for internal notes) and won’t be shown to participants. [\[Followup o...I research | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr3AAA%3d)
*   **Next Steps:** Avishag will outline the timeline – presumably, recruiting will start immediately after this meeting. Expect that she will submit the study request to the User Research panel team within a day or two. They plan to run sessions in early/mid December. Also, she might schedule a debrief meeting post-study – be prepared for that.  
    **Preparation:** Have the latest **Study Guide** doc open (likely in your OneDrive or as an attachment from Avishag). Bring the notes you made during your 11:00 focus review. Be ready to speak to any comment you added. For instance, if you suggested an extra question “What would make you trust using a CLI over the UI?”, explain your reasoning. Also, consider if there’s any critical scenario not yet covered by the questions (e.g. error handling expectations) – this is the time to bring it up. Note that some portions of the previous meeting were in Hebrew (see meeting transcript tasks) – ensure nothing got lost in translation. By meeting’s end, aim to have consensus that the guide and screener are final.  
    **Relevant History:** In the prior meeting, the team agreed on key points: *all participants must have at least basic CLI familiarity* (no complete novices), and the screener will filter for that. They also discussed how to handle the distinction between using Copilot vs CLI – you even gave an example of how an AI agent could generate a CLI script, which was noted as an interesting angle to explore. These insights are likely incorporated now.

**16:00 – \[Focus] Prep for Partner Voice session**  
**Participants:** *Solo work (focus time).*  
**Objective:** Continue building and refining the presentation for the **Partner Voice webcast on Dec 2**. This 2-hour block is to finalize the slide deck, demos, and speaking notes.  
**Context:** You have a webcast with Fabric partners coming up (Dec 2). This focus time on Sunday afternoon is likely when you’re putting together the core content. The session is titled “AI-Powered Automation in Fabric with Fabric’s MCP”, which indicates it will cover the Fabric CLI and the Model Context Protocol in the context of automation. You’ve already received guidance from the Partner Voice coordinator (Stephanie) about the audience and format. The plan is a 60-minute presentation + Q\&A, where you (as the presenter) will: introduce Fabric CLI, show how it can be used for automation, explain the MCP concept, possibly demo an example, and field questions. You blocked this time to ensure the materials are ready. (You also scheduled additional refinement on Monday at 11:00 and 16:00, indicating an iterative approach.)  
**Preparation Work Now:** [\[Present to...bric's MCP | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr9AAA%3d)

*   **Slide Deck:** By this point, you should have a draft deck. Make sure it tells a coherent story: start with what the Fabric CLI is and why it exists (e.g. “treat Fabric as a filesystem” concept), then transition into how it enables automation (CI/CD scenarios, scripting). Introduce MCP as the next evolution for AI-driven automation. Possibly frame MCP as “the way Copilot can execute tasks in Fabric” – but keep it high-level for partners. Incorporate any existing slides from your library – for example, you have slides from FabCon and prior Partner/Enterprise Voice sessions (there’s a Feb 2025 deck “Fabric CLI ⚡ Seamlessly Command Your Fabric” you authored, and a blog post in May announcing GA). Use those to reinforce points like CLI’s benefits: *familiar commands, scriptability, integration into pipelines.* Make sure to update any metrics (“thousands of users” is fine as a qualitative point). Emphasize new developments since GA: e.g. mention upcoming features like **running CLI commands in the web** (if you choose to hint at that) or the **hosted MCP**. [\[07-15-2025...ad Checkin | PowerPoint\]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/DevDivCentral/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B0FCC065D-DDAF-4A4D-8BB3-C16CD04ABACD%7D&file=07-15-2025%20App%20Workload%20Checkin.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) [\[Fabric CLI...— 20250220 | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BCB8BBF6C-0E61-4359-A719-D9E8956CC98C%7D&file=Fabric%20CLI%20@%20Partners%20Voice%20%E2%80%94%2020250220.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
*   **Demo Script:** Plan a concise demo that will wow the partner audience. A suggested scenario: **Automating a tedious admin task with AI + CLI.** For instance, demonstrate using the CLI to perform a bulk action across Fabric workspaces. You could say: “Imagine you want to enforce a naming convention across 100 workspaces. Instead of clicking through each, you can use an AI agent with MCP to generate a CLI script that renames them all, then run that script instantly.” This shows the power of combining Copilot (to generate the script) and CLI (to execute at scale). If a live demo is risky, prepare screenshots or a prerecorded snippet. Another idea: show the CLI doing something not possible in UI easily (like exporting a workspace’s metadata, then re-importing it) to highlight automation.
*   **Key Messages:** Partners should leave understanding **what Fabric CLI is** (a tool for automation and scripting Fabric, fully supported by MS), and **what MCP is** (an API-based automation service enabling Copilots and custom agents to perform tasks in Fabric). Make it clear how these two relate: e.g. “Fabric CLI can be thought of as one consumer of Fabric’s APIs, and MCP is another layer that allows AI to tap into those APIs safely.” This will set context that the CLI is available now and MCP is coming soon.
*   **Logistics:** Ensure the **Teams Live Event link** or webinar setup is handy (the invite at 6:00 PM is the formal event). Stephanie likely expects you to join 5 minutes early via the separate “Present to Partner Voice” invite at 5:55. Note that you’ll need to manage switching slides while speaking. If you want a backup, consider asking a teammate (maybe Ted Pattison or someone from CAT) to be on to help moderate Q\&A. (Ted was CC’d in planning emails, but it appears you’re the sole presenter on Dec 2.) If you haven’t already, fill out any required forms (Stephanie asked for roundtable questions – though those are for the later sessions – you might mention those roundtables during the webcast).  
    At the end of this focus block, you should have: the final slides ready in PowerPoint, demos prepared (with data and environment set up, and a dry run done), and a clear narrative. You will continue to tweak Monday, but by Sunday evening you want 90% readiness.

**20:00 – AAIC — Weekly Zoom (AI Community Call)**  
**Participants:** Hasan (host) + members of the ILDC AI community (broader invite, open attendance).  
**Objective:** A regular weekly Zoom meeting for the AAIC community, usually featuring an open discussion or presentation on an AI topic. This evening slot is likely a virtual meetup for anyone in the team to join from home.  
**Context:** The ILDC Fabric Platform team has this AI interest group (AAIC) that you spearhead. Sunday night’s “Weekly Zoom” suggests a casual catch-up. There’s no specific topic or speaker listed in the title. Often these are used to coordinate upcoming events (like the Open Lecture) or discuss interesting AI experiments. For example, perhaps you’ll talk about the content of tomorrow’s Open Lecture on GPT or share something new you learned about GPT-4. Attendance is optional (again, invites show no confirmed attendees).  
**Preparation:** Minimal. If nobody else has content, be ready to fill the time with an interesting AI demo or article mention. You might bring up a recent AI development or a relevant internal demo. If turnout is low, you can use it to prepare for the Monday lecture (e.g., troubleshoot Zoom or content with co-hosts). Since you had a 9 AM AAIC meeting the same day, check if anything from that needs follow-up now. Otherwise, treat this as an informal office-hours for AI discussion.  
**Note:** Because this is after work hours, keep it engaging and not too heavy. If no one joins, you can end early. If people do join, moderate a discussion about practical AI use cases in your projects, etc. [\[AAIC — Weekly Zoom | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE6ov87AAA%3d)

**21:00 – “Sync with Muhammad on GPT Lecture”**  
**Participants:** You; **Muhammad Asaly** (assuming this is the colleague preparing the lecture) – likely an ILDC engineer or AI enthusiast.  
**Objective:** Final prep sync for an upcoming **“GPT Lecture”** to be delivered as an open session (probably the AAIC Open Lecture on Monday). This meeting is to coordinate with Muhammad, who is presumably the speaker for that lecture, ensuring everything is ready.  
**Context:** Tomorrow (Dec 1 at 8 PM) there is an event “AAIC — Open Lecture” which presumably features a talk on GPT. The title here suggests Muhammad is the presenter for that lecture, focusing on GPT. You, as the organizer of the AAIC series, are meeting him to go over the content and logistics. Muhammad may want to run through his presentation outline or do a quick tech check. The lecture could be about GPT-4’s technical internals or applications in Fabric – whatever it is, you want to help make it run smoothly.  
**Preparation:** Review the plan for the Open Lecture. Make sure you know the **Zoom link, time (Dec 1, 8 PM)**, and audience (likely a mix of engineers from Haifa interested in AI). During this sync, confirm with Muhammad:

*   **Content** – the scope of his talk (so you can introduce him properly). For example, is it an overview of GPT models, a live demo, or lessons from a project he did?
*   **Duration** – how long he plans to speak vs. Q\&A. Typically these might be 30-45 min talks plus discussion. Ensure he’s comfortable with timing.
*   **Setup** – Will he share slides? Does he need any special setup? Test screen sharing if needed.
*   **Questions** – Anticipate what questions might come and how to handle them. Perhaps decide whether to take questions throughout or only at the end.
*   **Recording** – If you plan to record the session for those who can’t attend, inform him and test recording (with consent).  
    Since Muhammad is from a different discipline (the search in the directory shows a “Muhammad Asaly, Hardware Engineer” which might be him, meaning he’s outside the immediate software team), ensure his talk ties back to an AI theme that interests the group. Offer any help he might need – e.g., if he wants a dry run audience, or if he needs you to moderate the Q\&A. Also confirm you’ll be there to host and kick it off.  
    **Outcome:** By the end of this 1-hour sync, both you and Muhammad should feel confident about the lecture. You’ll have an intro prepared (e.g., “Tonight, Muhammad will share how GPT models can be leveraged...”). You’ll also clarify any last details (maybe verify access to the conference room or Zoom webinar if it’s hybrid). Essentially, this meeting ensures tomorrow’s event goes without a hitch.

### Monday, Dec 1, 2025

**10:00 – Fabric Native CLI Bi-Weekly Sync**  
**Participants:** Menglu Cui (Organizing PM, Fabric CLI team); you; possibly a few others (CLI engineering folks, though none others are explicitly listed).  
**Objective:** Routine check-in on the Fabric CLI development efforts, held every two weeks. This is a 30-minute sync to discuss progress, issues, and next steps for the CLI. Menglu (a Senior PM in China working closely on CLI) leads it.  
**Context:** With Fabric CLI now GA, the team is likely working on incremental features and support. This sync is to ensure PM and Engineering are aligned across regions. Topics often include: usage metrics, recent bug fixes, upcoming features, community contributions, etc. For example, Menglu might update on how many users have installed the CLI or any notable support tickets. You might discuss new features in development – e.g., the **global search command** or **client-side filtering** (JMESPath filter) which you proposed. Another topic is the CLI integration with VS Code and Copilot agents. Given you are pushing for an **interactive web CLI**, you might brief Menglu on the user study plan (so engineering is aware). Conversely, Menglu might share progress on backlog items from the October planning: there were plans for extension framework, `find` command, shell mode, etc..  
**Preparation:** Review the latest CLI status reports. There’s an “Automation Status” deck from Arina and Chen updated last week – check if it has fresh info on CLI (features marked DONE/WIP). Know any open bugs or customer feedback that came in (for instance, if any partner voiced an issue in the advisory forum, bring it up). Also, update yourself on CLI usage: how are the adoption numbers since GA? The May blog said “thousands” tried it; maybe by now usage stabilized – if you have telemetry access, glance at it (e.g., command invocation counts). Be ready to contribute on strategic items too: CLI’s **roadmap**. Some items for H1 2026 likely include *“CLI in Fabric UI”* (which you are spearheading, and this meeting is a chance to mention it), *batch operations support*, *further integration with CI/CD tools*, etc. Menglu will appreciate hearing about any upcoming demands (like changes needed for the hosted MCP integration).  
**During the Sync:** Each of you will share updates. When it’s your turn, highlight: the Partner Voice session focusing on CLI (so engineering knows you’re evangelizing it), the CLI research study, and any leadership input (Aviv/Kim’s interest areas). Also ask if engineering needs anything – e.g., are there any blockers from your side like spec decisions or cross-team coordination needed? Keep notes of any action items, such as updating documentation or scheduling a separate deep-dive on a feature. This meeting is mostly status, so high-level is fine.  
**Note:** Because it’s early Monday for you and late evening for Menglu, keep it focused and positive. End by confirming next steps (like “we expect to cut a new CLI release in mid-Dec with X feature” or “we’ll reconvene after the holidays if nothing urgent comes up”).

**10:35 – Fabric Embed Daily Standup**  
**Participants:** Alon Yeshurun (Organizer, Engineering Manager for Embed); core Fabric Embed dev team, possibly PMs like you optional.  
**Objective:** A quick 20-minute daily stand-up for the Fabric Embed workstream – to sync on any blockers and progress for that day. (It’s scheduled at 10:35 AM IL time each weekday.)  
**Context:** This is a daily scrum that Alon Yesh leads for the embed team. As PM for other platform areas, you are invited but not required. You sometimes join to stay informed on embed’s status, since platform efforts are interrelated. Given your own focus areas, you might skip most days – especially if you have no active tasks on embed. Check if there’s anything requiring your input today. For example, if any CLI work intersects with embed (perhaps something about embedded integration or an API that both teams use), you might want to attend. Or if an embed issue came up at last week’s all-hands that you need to follow up on, join and ask. If none, this meeting likely **does not require your presence or preparation**.  
**Preparation:** If you plan to join, quickly skim any updates in the Embed Teams channel. Did anything crop up? (E.g., capacity for embed service, or a bug escalated by a partner that you heard of.) If nothing urgent and you have conflicting work, it’s reasonable to skip or just dial in to listen.  
**Outcome:** If you attend, you’ll primarily listen to updates on embed features (like improvements to embed token handling or an ongoing bug with embedded Power BI). You can chime in if needed (perhaps mentioning that some embed telemetry might tie into MCP in future, but that’s optional). Otherwise, no action needed. This entry is mainly on your calendar because you’re part of the broader Platform PM group. Prioritize your time; since you have many prep tasks, it’s okay to miss this unless something specific needs you. [\[Fabric Embed Daily | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwFRAAgI3jBskinAAEYAAAAA6D9Em6wj90u1h5WM2_P3bwcA_5YkQF6ffUGaHc1jeoQyPgAAAAABDQAA_5YkQF6ffUGaHc1jeoQyPgAA3gYAaAAAEA%3d%3d)

**11:00 – \[Focus] Partner Voice Presentation (Continued)**  
**Participants:** *Solo work (focus time).*  
**Objective:** Refine the Partner Voice webcast presentation. This 1-hour slot is to integrate any overnight thoughts or feedback into your deck and possibly practice your talking points.  
**Context:** You made significant progress on Sunday in building the slide deck and demo for the Partner Voice session (see Nov 30, 16:00 entry). This Monday morning block lets you review it with fresh eyes. You may also have gotten input from colleagues (for example, if you sent Alon or Aviv a draft for review, check if they replied with comments). Now is the time to polish and finalize. The webcast is tomorrow, so you want the deck completed today.  
**Preparation Work Now:**

*   **Slide Edits:** Go through each slide and ensure it’s not too text-heavy and conveys the point clearly. Partners prefer real examples and visuals over theory. Add screenshots or diagrams where useful (maybe an architecture diagram showing how MCP sits between Copilot and Fabric APIs, for example). If you have any customer quotes or testimonials about CLI, include one for credibility (the GA blog quoted an MVP saying “game-changer for automation” – that could be a nice touch, attributed properly). Check for any jargon that might confuse an external audience – clarify or remove internal code names. [\[IgniteUpdates | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/teams/EMEAGPSGTM/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BCFCE7DE7-48BD-4C90-B1C3-326554D53B81%7D&file=IgniteUpdates.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
*   **Narrative Flow:** Practice the narrative in your head or out loud. For instance, ensure the transition from CLI to MCP is smooth: you might say *“Now that you’ve seen how the CLI can automate tasks, let’s talk about taking it further with AI. That’s where the Model Context Protocol comes in…”* Then explain MCP in partner-friendly terms (e.g. “a way for Copilot to safely run those CLI commands or other actions on your behalf”). Maybe use an analogy – such as explaining MCP as a “toolbox” of Fabric operations that AI agents can use.
*   **Demo Check:** If you prepared a live demo, do a quick run-through again. Ensure your CLI environment is authenticated (you don’t want to fumble with login during the session). Ensure sample data (like dummy workspace names for the renaming script scenario) is available. If the demo is risky, consider having a backup video or screenshots.
*   **Q\&A Prep:** Jot down 3-5 questions you expect and how you’ll answer. For example: *“When will hosted MCP be available for us to use?”* – You can answer: Public Preview is targeted for March 2026 (and you can invite interested partners to private preview earlier). Or *“Will CLI be integrated into the Fabric portal?”* – answer: It’s something the team is exploring (gauge interest). *“How does this compare to using PowerShell or REST APIs?”* – answer that CLI is built on REST APIs with added convenience and it’s officially supported, and MCP provides an API orchestration layer for AI. Preparing these will make you more confident.  
    During this hour, incorporate any small improvements. Aim to freeze the presentation by the end of this session so that later today you can focus on other work (and not scramble tomorrow). You have another short focus at 16:00 which you can use to do a final rehearsal. By now, the core content should be set.

**12:00 – \[Focus] Draft Internal Wiki for Fabric MCP Platform (Workload Onboarding)**  
**Participants:** *Solo work (focus time).*  
**Objective:** Develop the first draft of an **internal Wiki page** explaining how other Fabric teams can onboard their workloads or tools to the Fabric MCP platform (both local and hosted). Essentially, create contribution guidelines for adding new “tools” (capabilities) or even spinning up their own MCP servers (like a Unified Copilot agent for their workload). This will later be reviewed by your managers and engineering.  
**Context:** As discussed in planning sessions, part of making MCP successful is enabling other teams to use it. You need to document the **process and guidelines** clearly. This wiki will likely become the go-to reference for any team (Power BI, Data Activator, etc.) that wants to integrate with the platform’s MCP rather than building separate Copilot solutions. Based on internal conversations, the approach is to keep the process lightweight: *“we don't require a full onboarding review process for MCP tools, since it’s protocol-specific, but we do need to understand your scenario and ensure naming makes sense,”* as Mahir put it. In other words, unlike Public API onboarding which is strict, MCP onboarding can be more agile – but still coordinated. You will capture this philosophy in the wiki.  
**Content to Include:** [\[Notebook w...MCP Server | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_NWY4NTk2Y2ItZjVjZS00ZWVjLTkwNzktNDIzOWM1MDViOGQz@thread.v2/1763043686558?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D)

*   **Overview:** Start with a short intro: what is the MCP platform and why workloads might want to plug in (e.g. *“Fabric’s MCP platform allows any team to expose their product’s actions to Fabric Copilots and automation scripts in a consistent, secure way.”*). Emphasize that by contributing to the shared MCP, teams benefit from a unified Copilot experience.
*   **Key Concepts:** Define terms: *Tools* (individual actions/commands in MCP), *MCP Server* (the service hosting those tools, either local or hosted), *Unified Creator Agent* (if relevant, though that might be more future-facing – possibly omit for now to avoid confusion).
*   **Process Steps for Onboarding:** Lay out clear steps teams should follow. For example:
    1.  **Identify Scenarios & Tools:** Team decides which actions to enable (e.g. the Databricks team might add a “createLakehouse” tool). They should write a brief description of each tool’s function and parameters.
    2.  **Coordinate Naming/Scope:** They must contact the Platform team (you or designated contacts) with their plan. This is to ensure the tool names and categories fit logically and don’t conflict. (As Mahir’s Teams message indicates, it’s mainly about making sure the *URL alias and tool naming* is sensible – e.g., if a Notebook team adds Spark diagnostic tools, decide on a workload alias like “SparkDiagnostics” vs “NotebookMagic” to use in endpoints.) [\[Notebook w...MCP Server | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_NWY4NTk2Y2ItZjVjZS00ZWVjLTkwNzktNDIzOWM1MDViOGQz@thread.v2/1763043686558?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D)
    3.  **Develop & Test Tools:** Provide guidance on how to implement MCP tools. Likely point them to examples or a template in the code repo. (For instance, mention if they can use the existing MCP server codebase – perhaps a Python class for each tool with proper annotations, etc.) They should test locally (for local MCP) or in a dev environment (for hosted) with basic scenarios.
    4.  **Security/Compliance Checklist:** While we’re not doing a full API review, note that any new tool must adhere to Fabric security standards: respect user permissions (e.g., a tool should enforce that the user has access to the item it’s acting on), log usage for audit, and not expose sensitive data in plain text. If their tool might have side-effects beyond Fabric (e.g. calling an external API), they should flag that. But reassure them the Platform team will help with these considerations (the hosted MCP runtime already handles auth via AAD tokens, etc.).
    5.  **Submit for Integration:** Perhaps instruct them to either contribute code via the repository (if that’s the model – e.g. they fork the MCP repo and PR their tool code) or deliver the tool spec to the platform team to integrate. (Since MCP is moving fast, you might invite them to collaborate directly in code.) This step should include a quick review by you/Mahir’s team just to sanity check. But emphasize it’s not a lengthy approval process, more of a two-day turnaround to skim and deploy.
    6.  **Deployment & Maintenance:** Explain how their tools will get deployed in the Hosted MCP (e.g. “Platform team will deploy updated MCP servers periodically; once your tool passes tests, it can go live in the next deployment”). Also encourage them to attend the Weekly MCP Protocol calls if they want to stay updated. For Local MCP, if their tool is part of the open-source repo, it could ship in the next CLI extension release. [\[Weekly MCP...al Reviews | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwFRAAgI3irsaUWAAEYAAAAA6D9Em6wj90u1h5WM2_P3bwcA_5YkQF6ffUGaHc1jeoQyPgAAAAABDQAA_5YkQF6ffUGaHc1jeoQyPgABLTwc8gAAEA%3d%3d)
*   **Best Practices & Examples:** Provide a couple of illustrative examples. For instance: *“Notebook team Example:* they wanted to expose Spark job diagnostics via MCP. They created two tools ‘spark\_get\_app\_bottlenecks’ and ‘spark\_get\_stage\_task\_summary\_metrics.’ They coordinated with us to use the alias ‘SparkDiagnostics’ in the endpoint. They implemented the tools following our template and now those are available for Copilot to use” (this example actually matches the snippet Long Tian provided to Mahir – you can abstract that in simpler terms). Another example: *“Power BI Example:* if the PBI team wanted to allow an AI agent to create a report via MCP, they’d add a ‘createReport’ tool under a PowerBI category, etc.” Keep examples hypothetical but grounded. [\[Notebook w...MCP Server | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_NWY4NTk2Y2ItZjVjZS00ZWVjLTkwNzktNDIzOWM1MDViOGQz@thread.v2/1763043686558?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D), [\[Notebook w...MCP Server | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_NWY4NTk2Y2ItZjVjZS00ZWVjLTkwNzktNDIzOWM1MDViOGQz@thread.v2/1763043686558?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D)
*   **FAQ or Q\&A:** Possibly address a couple of anticipated questions. For instance: *“Do teams need to run their own MCP server?”* – Answer: No, we prefer to integrate tools into the central hosted server when possible, to keep one unified agent. But if a team has very specific needs, we can consider separate instances – talk to us. (This nods to the *Unified Creator Agent vs. specialized agent* discussion ongoing.) *“Can I opt out of using MCP for my workload’s Copilot?”* – Answer carefully; as per the unified agent spec discussion, they can opt out certain artifacts if not ready, but the general direction is to have one platform agent. So say something like: our goal is a unified approach, but if their scenario truly can’t use the shared platform, they should discuss with platform PMs (this maps to Sujata’s guidance: use Fabric MCP for basic CRUD across items, but workload owners can improve beyond that or “opt-out” if necessary).  
    **Tone and Approach:** Write the wiki in an inviting, supportive tone. Make it clear this is a partnership, not a gate. E.g., *“We’re here to help you be successful with MCP. Reach out anytime on Teams (#fabric-mcp channel or directly to @Hasan). We can even do a quick review meeting if needed.”*  
    **Preparation:** This focus time is for writing. Gather reference material first: open the Teams chat with Mahir and Long (Notebook MCP example) to remind you of the minimal process approach. Also recall points from the unified agent spec discussion that might relate – particularly Emily’s note that once they have the initial framework defined, they’ll share principles for other workloads to follow. Your wiki will likely be those “principles and steps” in draft form. Possibly incorporate a line that *“This guidance will evolve as we learn from early adopters (e.g., the RTD team’s MCP server, the Creator Agent project) – we will update this page continuously.”*  
    By the end of this session, aim to have a structured draft covering all the above. You can use headings in the wiki for Overview, Process, Best Practices, etc. Don’t worry about perfect wordsmithing now – get the content in place. You will share this draft with Alon and Aviv (and probably Mahir/Chen) for feedback soon after, so clarity is key.

**14:05 – PM Weekly Meeting**  
**Participants:** Aviv Ezrachi (Platform PM Lead, organizer); Platform PM team (you, Evelina, possibly others like Yifat in PM capacity); sometimes extended invitees (could include Dev lead Chen Israeli if he joins these, though primary dev sync is separate).  
**Objective:** A weekly staff meeting for the Platform PM team to share status updates, align on priorities, and surface any concerns. It’s scheduled for Monday 2:05 PM every week. Expect round-robin updates and discussion of upcoming events (like Kim’s visit next week).  
**Context:** This meeting is your manager (Aviv’s) forum to hear from all his PMs. Each person typically gives a brief update on their areas. Since this is the first meeting of December, and we’re mid-“Bromine” semester, topics might include: progress on key results, any adjustments after Thanksgiving, and final preparations for the leadership visit. Specifically, **your updates** will likely cover: [\[PM Weekly | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwFRAAgI3jBskinAAEYAAAAA6D9Em6wj90u1h5WM2_P3bwcA_5YkQF6ffUGaHc1jeoQyPgAAAAABDQAA_5YkQF6ffUGaHc1jeoQyPgAABxzl5QAAEA%3d%3d)

*   The status of CLI adoption and any metrics (maybe mention the GA usage and that you’re presenting to partners – demonstrating momentum on that KR).
*   MCP platform: mention that specs are ready and review sessions are planned this week (Aviv will know, but repeating it ensures others do too). Also highlight any early customer validation or interest (maybe note that some customers in CAB expressed desire for hosted MCP – showing demand). [\[Fabric aut...w - Nov 25 | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/tarostok_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B34E16F12-FF64-47AE-99EA-73988068E6E3%7D&file=Fabric%20automation%20and%20embedded%20execution%20review%20-%20Nov%2025.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
*   Copilot/Automation: likely a big topic since Kim’s visit focuses on it. Summarize the user research effort (so others know you have the CLI-in-web study in motion). Also mention unified Copilot planning if relevant – though that might be handled by someone else (Rui, who is PM for Creator Agent, isn’t in your team but collaboration exists). However, given you joined that spec review, you might inform the team that we’re aligning on one Creator Copilot across workloads and some decisions around that. Aviv will probably also talk about Kim and Laurent’s upcoming schedule and what is expected from each of you during the visit.  
    For other PMs: Evelina might update on Extensibility or on last week’s morale event, etc. Yifat (if present in PM capacity) might update on CI/CD progress or any blockers with external preview. Everyone will chime in if they have dependencies.  
    **Preparation:** Because you’re deep in prep for many things, your mind is full – which is good for sharing. Jot bullet points for your update:
    *   *“CLI:* Delivered GA, now focusing on integration – presenting to partners tomorrow, planning to integrate in web (research running). No major issues; usage steady, community engagement ongoing (some OSS contributions perhaps).”
    *   *“MCP:* Finalizing specs for Hosted & Local MCP (sending out today). Eng ready for review. We plan Private Preview in Jan. Also working on internal wiki for onboarding – will share draft soon.”
    *   *“Automation & Copilot:* Participating in unified Creator Agent design – ensuring CLI/MCP are part of that story. Also prepping for Kim’s visit – I’ll demo something if needed during Automation review.”
        Include any help you need: e.g. if you’re hoping to recruit certain customers for MCP preview, maybe ask if anyone has leads. Or if you worry about something for Kim’s roundtable, raise it.  
        Also be prepared to answer questions Aviv might ask: *“Do we have metrics on CLI usage?”* (have a ballpark or anecdote ready – e.g. “One MVP has already integrated it into their CI pipeline” or such), *“What’s the biggest risk for MCP timeline?”* (maybe resource bandwidth, but largely on track).  
        **Relevant History:** Last week there might not have been a meeting due to U.S. holiday, so this one could cover two weeks of news. Aviv circulated an email on Oct 16 praising the team’s impact and looking forward to Kim’s visit – he often uses these meetings to echo that positivity and ensure everyone is on the same page for such high-visibility events. Expect him to remind the team to be on-site Dec 10 and to sharpen their messaging. He may also mention any org updates or shout-outs (perhaps a quick thanks to whomever organized the Haifa morale event on Dec 2).  
        In sum, bring up anything noteworthy from your domain, absorb others’ info, and note any action items given (e.g., if Aviv asks for a one-pager for Kim, etc., though likely you’ve done those preparations already in spec decks and such). The atmosphere is usually informal but focused. This is your chance to ensure the PM team knows what you’re working on and to sync up ahead of the big on-site meetings next week.

**15:00 – \[Focus] Send MCP Specs for Review**  
**Participants:** *Solo task.*  
**Objective:** Send out the **Fabric Remote MCP spec** (and possibly the Local MCP spec) to relevant stakeholders via email/Teams, so they have time to read before the review meetings on Dec 2 and Dec 3. Ensure everyone invited has access to the documents and understands the context.  
**Context:** You finished polishing the specs by midday. Now you need to distribute them. The calendar invites for the review meetings have gone out, but it’s good practice to send the spec in advance (even if just one day) so attendees like Alon, Aviv, Tal, Mahir, etc. can skim. According to the invite details, none of the invited folks have accepted yet (likely they plan to attend but didn’t formally hit accept), but they are expecting this content. This focus block is simply to compose and send the email (or Teams message) with the spec links and a summary.  
**Steps:** [\[Fabric Rem...pec Review | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE4Ku0iAAA%3d), [\[Fabric Loc...pec Review | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE4Ku0jAAA%3d)

1.  **Compile Recipients:** Use the invite lists for “Fabric Remote MCP Spec Review” and “Fabric Local MCP Spec Review.” That includes: Alon Baram (PM manager), Aviv Ezrachi (group lead), Evelina Alroy-Brin and Tal Rostoker (fellow PMs), Mahir Diab, Chen Israeli, Yifat Sagiv, Ran Didi, Amos Hersch, Tomer Wintner (engineering leads/architects). Possibly also Rui Romano if he’s been involved, but he’s running a separate PM spec for the Creator Agent. Just stick to those in your invites. [\[Fabric Rem...pec Review | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE4Ku0iAAA%3d), [\[Fabric Rem...pec Review | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE4Ku0iAAA%3d), [\[Fabric Loc...pec Review | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE4Ku0jAAA%3d)
2.  **Email Content:** Write a concise email (or Teams chat message to the group) with a clear subject, e.g. “**Spec Documents – Fabric Hosted & Local MCP (for Review on 2 & 3 Dec)**”. In the body, thank them for their time in advance, provide links to the spec files (ensure permissions are such that all internal recipients can view/edit). Mention the version and that it’s ready for review. For example: *“Attached are the spec docs for the Fabric Hosted MCP service (v6.0) and the Fabric Local MCP (v4.0). These outline the design, scope, timeline (Private Preview Jan 2026, Public Preview Mar 2026), and open questions. Please review at your convenience before our meetings. Key areas of feedback we’re seeking: a) Are the proposed capabilities for M0 (Jan) sufficient? b) Any concerns on the security model? c) How to best involve workload teams (tie-in with unified agent). Feel free to add comments in the documents or come with notes.\*\*”* Adjust this wording as you see fit. The idea is to prime them on what to focus on.
3.  **Highlight Differences:** Note that the group of invitees is the same for both spec reviews and the docs are related. You might point out: *“The Hosted MCP spec covers the service that will run in Fabric (multitenant, AAD-authenticated) – this is the main new component. The Local MCP spec, on the other hand, is building on what we’ve already piloted (it’s how Copilot in VS Code executes code), and focuses on enhancements and how it works alongside the hosted service.”* This helps readers know what to look for in each.
4.  **Next Steps:** End the note by reiterating meeting times (just in case, e.g. *“We’ll discuss Hosted MCP tomorrow at 2:05 PM and Local MCP on Wed at 3:05 PM.”*) Encourage them to reach out with any pressing questions beforehand.  
    **Execution:** Actually send the email or post. Use whichever channel is most likely to get attention – probably email for formal spec delivery (you know some like Alon and Aviv manage email closely). Possibly also drop a quick message in Teams “Fabric Platform” channel that specs are emailed, for visibility.  
    By completing this task, you ensure a more fruitful review meeting, since folks will not be coming in cold. Mark the specs as shared in your OneDrive (if needed) so that any comments they make, you’ll see in real-time. After sending, double-check at least one recipient (say, Alon) got access without permission issues. Then relax – the heavy writing is done, now it’s about presenting and gathering feedback.

**16:00 – \[Focus] Partner Voice Presentation (Final Touches & Dry Run)**  
**Participants:** *Solo work (focus time).*  
**Objective:** Final practice and last-minute adjustments for the Partner Voice webcast presentation. This is a short buffer (1 hour) to run through the talk one more time, ensuring you’re fully prepared for tomorrow.  
**Context:** By now your slide deck and demo should be essentially finished. Use this time to simulate the webcast: talk through the slides as if you’re live, time yourself, and make sure the flow is smooth and within \~45 minutes to leave time for Q\&A. Since you’ve been working intensely on this, consider this a sanity check and then step away.  
**Preparation Work Now:**

*   **Dry Run:** Close your email/IM to avoid distractions. Start a timer (or note the clock). Go through your introduction, each slide’s talking points, execute part of the demo or at least describe what you’ll do (“Now I’ll switch to the CLI and run this script…”). Speak out loud as if the partners are listening. This will surface any awkward phrasing or too-long sections. For example, you might realize you have too many details on one slide – if you can’t cover it succinctly, decide if it’s necessary.
*   **Adjust for Time:** If your run-through is, say, 50 minutes and you need it shorter, identify where to trim. Perhaps you can drop a lesser important demo step or condense the explanation of a well-known concept (e.g., you don’t need to belabor “what is CLI” if the audience is technical – a quick recap will do). Also plan which parts you might skip if time is running short live. It’s good to know your “cuttable” sections in advance.
*   **Tech Check:** Make sure the laptop or PC you’ll present from is ready – if using the same device now, test that PowerPoint is working fine, the demo environment is still logged in, etc. If you’ll be in the office vs. home, ensure you have any adapters or permissions needed to present on Teams Live (should be fine).
*   **Finalize Speaking Notes:** If you have speaker notes in PowerPoint or a separate outline, refine them. You might jot down specific phrases for tricky points or exact figures you don’t want to forget (like “targeting Public Preview by March”). However, remember to keep the delivery natural – use notes as backup, not a script.  
    Since this is the last chunk of work on the deck, also consider if you want to share the deck with the Partner Voice team beforehand (Stephanie might appreciate having it). It’s not required, but you could send it shortly after this if you want feedback, though at this late stage it may not be necessary.  
    **Confidence Check:** Ensure you feel comfortable with the content. The audience will be partners (likely familiar with Fabric but not deep insiders), so aim to be informative yet approachable. You’re basically done – use this time to build confidence. If something still worries you (e.g., a live demo risk), decide now how to handle it (maybe have a backup slide). It’s better to finalize those decisions today than stress tomorrow.  
    By the end of this hour, you should be breathing easier. Store everything in an accessible place (if presenting from a conference room, maybe put the PPT on OneDrive accessible from there or bring your laptop). After this, you can turn attention to other meetings, knowing this big one is under control.

**18:30 – \[PM Spec Review] Fabric MCP Tools for Unified Creator Agent (#2)**  
**Participants:** Rui Romano (organizer, PM from Power BI working on Creator Agent), Ofri Dar (PM, likely in data team), Sujata Narayana (PM lead for Copilot experiences), Parker Pavlicek (PM, likely Fabric UX), Patrick Wheeler (PM, possibly OneLake or SaaS experiences), Taylor Clark (Engineer or PM with Copilot team), Anshul Sharma (Engineer on semantic models), Filip Krzeminski (Engineer on agentic platform), Emily Lisa (PM, Copilot ecosystem) – and you, plus others from various teams (Will Thompson from Power BI, etc., some came and went in the last meeting).  
**Objective:** A cross-team spec review to discuss the **Fabric “Unified Creator” Copilot Agent** and how MCP tools will be utilized for it. This is labeled “#2”, implying a continuation from an earlier discussion. The goal is to refine the plan for the unified Copilot that spans multiple Fabric workloads, including what tasks it will handle via the common MCP and where workload-specific logic or opt-outs apply. Essentially, it’s about how **MCP tools** feed into the One Copilot experience for creators.  
**Context:** This is not your spec, but you’re a key stakeholder because the outcome heavily relies on the MCP platform you’re building. In the first review (last week or earlier), there was extensive debate (as seen in the Teams chat log you have) on how to structure the agent’s capabilities and how workloads participate. Major points from that discussion: [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D), [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D), [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D) [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D), [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D)

*   The vision is to have a **single “Creator” Copilot agent** that can assist with cross-workload tasks (create a workspace, add items, maybe even ingest data). This agent will use the **Fabric MCP (Hosted)** for basic operations across products.

*   Workload teams can **opt out or override certain tasks** if the generic approach isn’t good for their product. Example: If an agent requests a task on a workload that isn’t fully supported, that workload’s PM might choose to remove that capability for now (“opt out of an artifact vs entire workload” was debated – conclusion was opt-out at artifact level makes more sense). [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D), [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D)
*   There was discussion about **semantic errors and limitations** – e.g., some product’s API (like OneLake) might not expose detailed info the agent needs. Or certain tasks like “list Kusto tables” require data-plane calls beyond our MCP currently (Anshul pointed out limitations: e.g., listing tables in Eventhouse uses Kusto commands that our OneLake API doesn’t cover). So the spec likely addresses where MCP falls short and how to handle it (like instructing the agent to only attempt what’s supported). [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D), [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D) [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D)
*   **Ownership of best practices (“when to use what”)**: A big question is who defines the logic for choosing between Fabric components. E.g., if a user says “bring this CSV into Fabric,” should the agent create a pipeline vs. a dataflow vs. a Lakehouse? Will Thompson asked who writes those rules. Sujata noted it should live in the Creator agent’s knowledge, but it’ll require alignment among SLT so the agent’s choices reflect agreed “product truth”. This is a political can of worms, and Kim’s involvement will be needed to settle some things. You added that the agent should respect user preferences too (not force one approach), which everyone agreed with. [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D) [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D), [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D)
*   **Hosting & Infrastructure:** Will asked if platform will offer a place to host any custom sub-agents if needed. Emily responded that it’s early, but part of the plan is indeed to have a way for other agents to plug in later. Filip mentioned they’re working on an “Agentic platform” for hosting agents and connecting MCP servers with security, session management, etc.. So, yes, the platform (meaning you and engineering) will likely provide an infrastructure so that if down the line, say, the Data Activator team builds a specialized agent, there’s a consistent way to deploy it. For now, focus is on the one Creator agent. [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D)
*   **Action Items for this meeting (#2):** Last chat messages show consensus forming: Use Fabric MCP for basic CRUD across workloads (like create workspace, add dataset, etc.), allow teams to **opt in/out** as needed (with default being opt-in to common path), and ensure guidelines are documented for teams to onboard their “hero scenarios” later. The meeting likely aims to finalize that approach. Possibly reviewing a document “Spec - Fabric MCP Tools for Creator Agent.docx” which Rui shared in chat. Since you have context from chat, you know what’s inside: it probably outlines initial scenarios the agent will handle using MCP (like create workspace, create lakehouse, maybe adding a simple pipeline, etc.), and lists which teams need to provide tools or approve those actions. It likely also covers the opt-out mechanism (maybe a config where a workload can mark a command as not agent-ready).  
    **Your Role:** You’re here representing the platform team and MCP. Ensure decisions align with the realities of MCP’s capabilities and timeline. Key things you should convey or watch for: [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D), [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D) [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D)
*   **Timeline Alignment:** The Creator Agent is likely aiming for a demo or preview by mid next year. Make sure they understand what MCP will deliver when: by March, hosted MCP will support primarily control-plane actions (workspaces, capacities, standard item creation). Some data-plane or advanced actions might not be there yet. So if someone suggests “the agent should also rename columns in a Lakehouse,” that might not be feasible if the MCP doesn’t expose it in time. Advocate focusing agent scenarios on what MCP can do by then (which should cover a lot of admin tasks).
*   **Tool Coverage:** Confirm which MCP tools are considered for the agent’s MVP. Likely: create workspace, set permissions, create Lakehouse, create pipeline, etc. Possibly Power BI create report? But PBI may not have all APIs in MCP yet. Help identify gaps: e.g., listing items (for search) – we have a search API under development. If the agent needs something not in MCP, highlight it so it can be prioritized or the scenario trimmed. (Anshul’s comment was a great example – search/list table content might be beyond our immediate scope.) [\[CLI Search Command | Word\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B574366BA-A7BF-4AEF-A485-6A83046C1314%7D&file=CLI%20Search%20Command.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D)
*   **Opt-Out Mechanism:** Ensure everyone is clear how a workload “opts out” if needed. The chat leaned toward opting out at artifact (item) level instead of entire workload. For instance, maybe the Power BI team might say “the agent shouldn’t attempt to create a paginated report because it’s complex,” so they’d exclude that specific command. Make sure any mechanism is doable (could be as simple as not implementing that tool in MCP, or a flag in a registry – up to engineering). Since you’ll maintain the “catalog” of MCP tools, you might be involved in implementing opt-out flags. [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D), [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D)
*   **ByoAgent hosting:** Will’s request about a common infra for hosting custom agents is forward-looking. Emily and Filip responded that the platform team (i.e., you all) are working on it. Be prepared to summarize that: *“Yes, as Filip mentioned, we’re designing the platform to allow multiple agents and MCP servers to be hosted. Initially we’ll just have the one Hosted MCP and Creator Agent, but the framework will be extensible for others to plug in.”* This assures Will/others that, in the future, they won’t have to reinvent infrastructure to run their own specialized Copilot.  
    **Preparation:** Read through the chat transcript again to have specifics in mind (you have already, but a quick skim won’t hurt to ensure you recall who said what – many participants, and it’s good to acknowledge their points accurately). If Rui circulated the spec doc separately (maybe via email or Teams – check if you got something like “Spec - Creator Agent” in mail), skim that too. It may contain scenario lists or requirements that weren’t all in chat. Think through any potential conflicts or concerns from your side: One might be **performance and load** – if the unified agent sends a burst of calls to MCP (e.g., user asks to set up 10 things at once), is the MCP service ready? Possibly mention rate limiting or that we’ll monitor usage; but since internal usage at first will be modest, it’s likely fine. Another concern could be **error handling** – as Sujata noted, don’t assume the agent can’t do something unless proven; but ensure errors from MCP propagate clearly so agent can react. You might need to ensure the Hosted MCP will give meaningful error messages to the Copilot (this is an implementation detail, but you can confirm we plan to do that).  
    During the meeting, expect Rui to walk through the spec or decisions needed. Provide input concisely – many voices will be there. where possible, base answers on facts (e.g., “The Hosted MCP *will* support X by that time, but *will not* support Y, so maybe limit scope to X for now” etc.). Also, this is cross-team, so keep an open mind to their needs – if a team really wants a special capability, you might accommodate via the local MCP or a workaround. But also remember Kim will ultimately arbitrate on cross-workload priorities (as Sujata hinted).  
    **Outcome:** By the end, the group should finalize how the first version of the unified Creator Copilot will use MCP and what each team’s responsibilities are. Likely outcomes: a list of MCP tools to implement (some by platform, some by workloads if new ones needed), a plan for any opt-outs (hopefully minimal), and action items to document or communicate the approach to all workload teams. They might ask you to incorporate some of this guidance in your wiki for MCP onboarding – which you are already doing (like clarifying how a team can mark a tool as not ready for AI usage – perhaps by not exposing it in production until tested).  
    Be ready to take away any tasks related to MCP updates. For example, if they decide “We need a new MCP tool for Data Activator to start/stop a detection” and no one from that team is on, you might volunteer to follow up with that team. Or if an existing tool needs an enhancement for agent use (like adding a parameter to create a workspace with certain template), note that for your backlog.  
    This meeting is high-level cross-team design; your preparation and context on MCP ensures that decisions will be grounded in what’s feasible. Continue to be the voice of practicality and platform unity (which you’ve been, judging by your chat inputs). It’s a big piece in fulfilling the vision Kim and Laurent will hear about on Dec 10 (the “Unified Creator Agent” idea), so helping resolve these technical details now is crucial.

**20:00 – AAIC — Open Lecture: “GPT”**  
**Participants:** Hasan (host/facilitator), **Muhammad Asaly** (presenter), ILDC team members interested in AI (various, potentially 10-30 people, including engineers and PMs from Haifa). Possibly Kim and Laurent may even drop by if they arrived early and heard (though the invite doesn’t show them, it’s an internal community event not on their official schedule).  
**Objective:** An internal evening session where Muhammad will give a talk on GPT. The goal is educational and community-building – allowing team members to learn about GPT technology and discuss it. As host, your objective is to introduce the speaker, ensure the session runs smoothly, and moderate Q\&A.  
**Context:** This is the event you and Muhammad prepared for on Sunday night. The topic likely revolves around GPT models (e.g., GPT-4 architecture, prompt engineering, or how to use GPT in Fabric context). It’s part of the AAIC (AI community) meetings, often held in a casual tone after work hours. The invite title is “AAIC — Open Lecture” and location might be a conference room or Teams/Zoom (the earlier invite for a morale event at Wadi Nisnas indicates some events are in-person; check if this lecture is in-person on campus or via Zoom – likely Zoom given the broad invite and timing).  
**Preparation:** Arrive/log in a bit early. Make sure Muhammad is set up to present (slides loaded, mic working). Welcome attendees as they join. Perhaps start with a quick note: *“Thanks for joining our AAIC Open Lecture series. Tonight, Muhammad Asaly will talk about GPT and share some insights from his work/interest in the area.”* Formally introduce him: name, role (e.g., “Hardware Engineer on the Core team, and an AI enthusiast”), and topic title.  
During the lecture, you simply observe and make note of any interesting points or questions that arise in chat. Keep an eye on time; if he was given, say, 45 minutes, gently signal if he’s running long (though since this is informal, a bit over is fine if audience is engaged).  
**Q\&A Moderation:** After he finishes, facilitate the Q\&A. Encourage questions: *“Feel free to unmute or drop questions in chat.”* If silence, have one question ready to kick off (you can prepare one: e.g., “Muhammad, how do you see GPT’s capabilities evolving in the next year, and what could that mean for our work?”). That can spark others. If discussion gets too deep or side-tracked, politely steer it or wrap up if time is up.  
**Logistics:** If this is on Zoom, ensure recording if you planned (only if previously communicated). Usually these internal talks might be recorded for those who missed it – if doing so, announce at start (“We’ll record this session for those unable to attend live”). If not, no problem. Also manage any technical issues – e.g., if someone can’t hear, help troubleshoot briefly.  
Given it’s after work, keep the atmosphere light and appreciative. At conclusion, thank Muhammad for preparing the talk and thank everyone for attending. Mention if there’s a next lecture planned (if any in pipeline) or encourage others to volunteer to speak in future. This further fosters the community.  
**Relevant History:** This lecture series (AAIC open lectures) might have had previous talks (perhaps on other AI topics). If you recall who spoke earlier, you could mention “Last time we talked about computer vision, today NLP with GPT – great to see the interest!”. Also, consider any connection to Fabric: maybe highlight that understanding GPT is directly relevant given Fabric’s Copilot efforts. Something like, *“As you know, we’re building AI copilots in Fabric – so understanding models like GPT is super valuable. Thanks to sessions like these, we all get a bit smarter about the tech behind the magic.”* (This connects the lecture to everyday work.)  
**Aftermath:** Once done, ensure the room/meeting is closed properly (if physical, clean up; if virtual, end the meeting). Possibly post a thank-you in the Teams channel the next day with maybe the slide deck if Muhammad is willing to share, or key takeaways.  
This event doesn’t require extensive content prep from you (Muhammad handles the content). Your role is facilitator and community cheerleader. It’s the kind of event that boosts morale and knowledge, so even though it’s after hours, it’s worth the effort, especially ahead of Kim’s visit (shows strong team engagement with AI). Enjoy the talk, as it’s also a chance for you to learn and get inspired outside of your immediate work.

### Tuesday, Dec 2, 2025

**10:00 – Haifa Morale Event (Holiday Market Visit)**  
**Participants:** Fabric ILDC team in Haifa (employees from Platform and perhaps other local teams; organized by the ROB or ops team). You have tentatively accepted. Possibly Alon, Evelina, other colleagues will be there.  
**Objective:** Team social event – visiting **Wadi Nisnas** (a cultural neighborhood in Haifa) during the holiday season. It’s a combined morale and cultural experience outing, likely including food and a tour of the Holiday Market there.  
**Context:** This is part of the “Haifa Morale event” organized by Fabric Platform ILDC ROB (probably the business admin or ops team). It’s scheduled from 10:00 AM to 1:30 PM, indicating perhaps a half-day off-site. Wadi Nisnas is known for its Holiday Festival in December, with Christmas decorations, local Arab-Jewish food stalls, etc. The team likely planned this to celebrate end-of-year and let Kim & Laurent (if they arrive by then, though their official meetings start Dec 10, so they might not be here yet) see local culture. Considering you have critical work (Partner Voice presentation) in the evening and spec reviews this day, attending a 3.5-hour outing might be challenging. You tentatively accepted, meaning you’re interested but not 100% committed.  
**To Attend or Not:** Check your schedule conflicts: You have the MCP spec review at 2:05 PM and the Partner Voice webinar prep (and actual event at 6 PM). The morale event ends by 1:30, so in theory you can go for most of it and be back by the spec meeting. It’s local in Haifa, so travel time is minimal (Wadi Nisnas is in Haifa city, near downtown, maybe \~15 min from office). If you feel comfortable stepping away in the morning (since everything for Partner Voice is done and spec emails are sent), attending would be good for team spirit. If you have last-minute tasks, you might skip or join late.  
**Preparation:** If attending, dress casually and wear comfortable shoes (it’s a walking tour likely). No actual “prep” needed beyond maybe carrying some cash for market snacks and a jacket if weather is cool. The invite suggests it’s purely social, so unplug and enjoy. Possibly partners from other ILDC teams will join – good chance to network informally.  
**While There:** Bond with colleagues. Chat with Alon, Evelina, etc., in a non-meeting setting – often valuable conversations happen in these events (but don’t turn it into a work meeting; just build rapport). Perhaps see if anyone has thoughts about the upcoming visit of Kim – but keep it light. If you know any interesting facts about Wadi Nisnas or the Holiday Festival, share them. Take pictures for fun.  
**Post-Event:** You’ll likely head back to the office or home by 1:30. Ensure you have a buffer to refocus on work after the fun. A quick transition – maybe grab a coffee afterward to switch gears for the spec review at 2:05.  
**If Skipping:** If you decide you can’t spare the time (maybe if something came up), politely inform the organizer (Fabric Platform ROB alias) that you won’t be able to make it. Given it’s not a mandatory event, that’s okay, but it’s good to make an appearance if you can. It shows team spirit.  
Overall, this event is for enjoyment – no action items or serious context needed. It’s included here for completeness, but indeed, **no preparation or follow-up required** except to have fun and connect with your teammates. [\[Haifa Morale event | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr7AAA%3d)

**14:05 – Fabric Remote MCP Spec Review Meeting**  
**Participants:** Hasan (you, organizer/Presenter), Alon Baram (PM Manager), Aviv Ezrachi (Group PM Lead), Evelina Alroy-Brin and Tal Rostoker (Platform PMs), Mahir Diab (Engineering Manager – MCP dev lead), Yifat Sagiv (Director of Engineering), Ran Didi (Engineer), Amos Hersch (Engineer), Tomer Wintner (Engineer), Chen Israeli (Principal Engineer) – in short, Platform PM and Engineering leadership. Likely all in Haifa (some may join remotely if needed).  
**Objective:** Present and obtain feedback/approval on the **Hosted (Remote) Fabric MCP Server Spec**. This 55-minute session focuses on the design of the cloud-hosted MCP service (as opposed to the local MCP). You want to confirm that everyone aligns on the scope, design choices, and timeline so that engineering can proceed. Essentially, **get a green light** on the hosted MCP plan.  
**Context:** You distributed the spec in advance yesterday with key points to focus on. The meeting will likely proceed as: you give a short overview, then open discussion on questions. Specific things to cover: [\[Fabric Rem...pec Review | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE4Ku0iAAA%3d)

*   **Goals & Scenarios:** Remind the room why we’re doing the hosted MCP: e.g., *“to allow Copilots and other services to perform Fabric actions securely in the cloud, without requiring a user’s local environment.”* Highlight that this unlocks scenarios like the unified Copilot agent (which they’re aware of) and partner integrations. Perhaps mention a simple example scenario: an AI agent could create a workspace and assign users in one go – something difficult to do manually at scale.
*   **Architecture & Components:** Walk through how the Hosted MCP will work. For instance: *It will run as a service in our Fabric infrastructure, probably as a microservice in the same region as Fabric’s control plane. It will receive requests (likely via a REST API endpoint under api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/mcp/...). It uses AAD authentication (user or service principal tokens) and then executes the requested action by calling Fabric’s internal APIs.* Show this flow in a diagram if one is in the spec. Emphasize that it uses the same model as the local MCP in terms of translating natural language or simplified commands into API calls, but now hosted. Possibly mention how it will be invoked: from Copilot or even directly by power users eventually.
*   **Scope (MVP):** State clearly what the initial release (Private Preview M0 in Jan) will support. For example: *“We plan to support core control-plane operations: creating and managing workspaces, datasets, lakehouses, pipelines, permissions, etc., basically any existing public API we have. More specifically, MVP tools include: CreateWorkspace, CreateLakehouse, list items, assign user roles, etc.*” (List a few to illustrate.) Also mention what’s **out-of-scope for M0**: e.g. *“No data plane operations – we’re not supporting things like running Spark jobs or executing SQL through MCP in this phase, and no file upload/download (that remains local only for now).”* This ensures focus. Show the timeline: Private Preview Jan (target a small set of internal scenarios or maybe one friendly customer via TAP), Public Preview by \~March (FabCon) for broader use.
*   **Security & Governance:** This is critical to get buy-in. Reiterate how **authentication** works: the hosted MCP will require an Azure AD token with appropriate Fabric permissions – it runs under the user’s identity (or a service principal’s identity), so it cannot do anything the user couldn’t do through APIs themselves. Also mention **governance controls**: likely, all actions are audited (we’ll log MCP invocations to the Fabric activity log). If there are any admin controls (like the ability for a tenant admin to disable MCP usage for their org, if decided), mention that concept even if not in MVP. Customers previously asked that MCP respect scope and roles, and your plan does: each tool call will enforce normal role checks (e.g. if an agent tries to create a workspace, it must be an admin or capacity admin as usual). Confirm that. Bring up the **concern of cost** if any – e.g., reassure that MCP doesn’t circumvent any licensing (the operations performed still consume whatever capacity or are subject to same limits – this might not need deep discussion now, but be ready in case someone asks how do we avoid an agent running up costs. You might answer: by existing Fabric governance – e.g., capacity limits, API call limits – and we can also implement throttling if needed). [\[Fabric aut...w - Nov 25 | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/tarostok_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B34E16F12-FF64-47AE-99EA-73988068E6E3%7D&file=Fabric%20automation%20and%20embedded%20execution%20review%20-%20Nov%2025.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
*   **Open Questions for Feedback:** You likely flagged a few in the spec. Common ones might be: *“Do we want a single entry point that intelligently routes to local vs remote MCP as needed, or just separate endpoints?”* Or *“What is the best way to handle long-running operations?”* (One idea: agent asks MCP to do something that might take minutes, do we hold the request open or have an async pattern?). Also possibly *“How should we package the remote MCP tools for external devs – fully hidden behind Copilot or also accessible via CLI?”* If any of those are unresolved, bring them up. However, given audience and time, focus on the key ones where you need leadership direction. For instance, the **unified endpoint** question: Laurent had previously shown interest in a unified MCP concept, but that’s future. For MVP, it’s fine to have distinct local vs hosted. Maybe mention that future vision but note it’s out of scope for now.
*   **Workload Extensions:** Mention how other teams can add tools to the hosted MCP (tie to your wiki efforts). E.g., *“We will maintain a central catalog of MCP ‘tools’. Initially, it includes standard Fabric operations. As teams like Power BI or Data Activator want to add specialized actions, they can contribute those – we’re working on an onboarding doc. Our design allows adding new tools without redesigning the whole system.”* This touches collaboration and should please those like Yifat or Ran (architects who care about extensibility). It aligns with what Emily said about supporting more agents later.  
    **Meeting Flow:** You likely have \~30 minutes to present and clarify, then \~25 minutes for discussion. People like Alon, Aviv will voice if they have concerns or if something needs de-scoping. Some expected questions or feedback: [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D)
    *   Alon/Aviv might ask about **progress** – how far along is engineering? Is Jan realistic? (Mahir can speak to that: probably yes for core functions, given no heavy UI is needed, mainly backend work which might already be underway after v6 spec.)
    *   Yifat or Chen might ask about integration with existing Fabric API infrastructure – e.g., ensuring we reuse as much as possible and not duplicate logic. They might also ask how the MCP service will scale or if there are any performance concerns. Have an answer like: the workload per request is modest (translating text to API calls is either using our template approach or eventually using an LLM – mention if MVP uses rules or small model). And it will scale out in our microservice environment as any other Fabric service.
    *   Mahir might raise any engineering constraints – if he hasn’t already offline. Perhaps he’ll mention what’s hardest to implement to set expectations (listen and ensure that’s reflected in timeline).
    *   Someone might ask: *“What if a Copilot tries something MCP can’t do yet?”* Answer: The Copilot will receive an error or inability and should handle gracefully (maybe say “in first iteration, Copilot’s prompts will be tuned to what MCP can do, to avoid bizarre requests”).
        **Preparation:** Review your spec document and make sure you can articulate each section clearly without reading it. Maybe prepare a short slide or two, or at least an outline to speak from. However, given likely all are internal and familiar with context, you could even open the spec and navigate in real-time to pertinent sections (some prefer that for spec review). Choose whichever style you think this audience likes – often, a few summary slides focusing discussion works well. Perhaps have a slide of “Key design points & questions” as a focus.  
        Also, recall any prior feedback from these stakeholders: e.g., earlier in year, some might have been skeptical of usability; but since then, leadership is on board. Still, be ready to justify the investment: mention how this plays into Fabric being an “AI-native” platform (Kim’s theme of turning Fabric into an intelligence platform depends on MCP). That strategic alignment will resonate.  
        **Outcome:** Ideally, you get a nod from Alon/Aviv to proceed with the spec as is (“LGTM”). They might suggest minor tweaks – e.g., “ensure to engage security champs for a quick review” or “maybe don’t publicly announce X capability until it’s proven.” Take notes on any such. If there’s a major concern (unlikely, given you’ve socialized this well), address it or agree to address it by next iteration. Since you have all key people here, this meeting should close with a shared understanding: Hosted MCP M0 = Jan with XYZ features, M1 = Mar with maybe a bit more, and everyone supports that. This also arms them with info before Kim’s visit – they can confidently speak to how we plan to deliver MCP to customers soon.  
        Be proud – this is a big piece of your work coming to fruition. Once approved, it’s execution time for dev. Immediately after the meeting (or next day in Local spec review) you might get into more nitty-gritty with Mahir on action items (like setting up environment, writing test scenarios, etc.), but for now, focus on consensus and clarity. [\[Fabric-MCP-Strategy1 | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/habos_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B144E56AC-2874-4414-97CE-84EF0CDF3E9E%7D&file=Fabric-MCP-Strategy1.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

**17:55 – Join Partner Voice Webcast: “AI-Powered Automation in Fabric (MCP & CLI)”**  
*(Note: Two overlapping invites for \~5:55 and \~6:00 likely refer to prep and actual event. Combine them.)*  
**Participants:** Hasan (Presenter), Stephanie Chimeziri (Partner Voice coordinator, host), \~50-100 external partner representatives (developers, architects, MVPs) in the Teams Live event, possibly Ted Pattison (just listening or helping moderate Q\&A), and maybe a couple of supporting MS folks (Partner Voice team, or co-presenters if any).  
**Objective:** Deliver the Partner Voice webcast showcasing Fabric’s CLI and MCP capabilities for automation, and engage partners in Q\&A. The goal is to educate and excite partners about using the CLI for automation and give a glimpse of upcoming AI-driven automation (MCP). Also, gather their feedback/questions to inform our work.  
**Context:** This is the session you meticulously prepared. It runs from 6:00–7:00 PM, but you are joining at 5:55 to get set up. Partners join via a live event link; they can see your slides and hear you, and post questions in chat. Stephanie will likely introduce you and manage the event logistics. You will then present (\~40-45 min), possibly with a demo, then answer questions. This is an official outreach as part of the Partner Voice Advisory program, which means these attendees are under NDA and keenly interested in Fabric. Some may already be testing Fabric features. Expect intelligent questions.  
**Live Presentation Tips:** [\[Present to...bric's MCP | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr9AAA%3d) [\[Partner Vo...bric's MCP | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE1AJr8AAA%3d)

*   Join early and verify audio, video, screen-sharing. Greet Stephanie and ensure she can see your slides. Check that the “start broadcast” happens properly. Perhaps you did a tech test with her earlier – if not, trust Teams Live basics.
*   While presenting, speak clearly and not too fast (especially for non-native English listeners). Use the structure you practiced: Opening (the “why” of CLI & MCP, tying to partner needs like automation), then the main content (CLI intro, demos, MCP concept), then closing (roadmap and where to find more info/documentation).
*   Engage with the audience even though it’s one-way video: ask rhetorical questions like “We know many of you build solutions that need to automate tasks – how do you do it today? Likely scripts or PowerShell… We want to make that easier with CLI and even AI.” This keeps them mentally involved.
*   **Demo execution:** If live, narrate what you’re doing. For example, “Here I’m using the Fabric CLI to list all workspaces… now I’ll run a command to create a new workspace named ‘PartnerVoiceDemo’… and it’s done (highlight the output).” If something fails, don’t panic – have that backup option ready (maybe quickly switch to a screenshot). Since you practiced, it should be smooth.
*   **Time management:** Keep an eye on time stamps (maybe have a clock visible). Ideally finish slides+demo by \~6:45 to allow \~15 min for Q\&A. Stephanie will moderate questions (she might read them out for you). If running behind, subtly pick up pace or skip a less important demo segment.
*   **Enthusiasm:** Show energy and passion. This is exciting stuff – your attitude will influence their perception. Especially when talking about upcoming MCP, convey how it could transform automation (e.g., *“Imagine not having to write the script at all – an AI agent can handle routine tasks for you, on-demand. That’s where we’re headed.”*).  
    **Q\&A Expectations:** Partners may ask:
    *   *“When can we get our hands on this?”* – You can answer: Fabric CLI is GA (point them to docs if available), and they can use it today. The Hosted MCP/AI automation is coming – likely say *“We plan to preview AI-driven automation in the new year; stay tuned for announcements around March.”* (That’s safe given Public Preview timeline). Possibly offer to involve some in private trials if appropriate (Stephanie might prefer to manage that list).
    *   *“Is the CLI scriptable/CI-CD friendly?”* – Answer: Yes, it’s designed exactly for that, you can use it in pipelines (some partners likely want to integrate Fabric into their deployment pipelines – assure them CLI or REST APIs enable that).
    *   *“How does security work with MCP and CLI?”* – You can say: CLI uses the user’s identity (OAuth login); MCP will also run under the user or service principal identity with full auditing. Emphasize no special new attack surface beyond normal API usage.
    *   *“Will Copilot fully replace the need for us to write scripts?”* – Answer: Copilot will simplify many scenarios, but CLI and scripting will remain powerful tools. They complement each other. (Partners often want to know if their skills remain relevant – reassure them that CLI is here to stay, Copilot will use the same under the hood).
    *   *“Is there an API for MCP we can call directly?”* – Perhaps someone forward-looking might ask. You can mention: the MCP service will expose endpoints, but primary use is via Copilot/CLI for now. Over time, we might expose it more directly if that scenario emerges. For now, partners can call Fabric’s REST APIs themselves for custom automation (which they already do), or use CLI in headless mode in scripts.
    *   *“Any plans for PowerShell or other language support?”* – Possibly. Answer: Right now, focus is CLI (which is cross-platform via Python). A PowerShell module for Fabric could be considered if demand (gauge interest). For now, CLI and REST cover scenarios.  
        Take note of recurring feedback or any specific requests (these can be gold for product planning). Stephanie may send a summary after; but as presenter, showing you care about their input by actively listening and responding goes a long way.  
        **After the Session:** Thank everyone and direct them to resources: for example, docs link (if any public docs or blog for CLI), GitHub repo if they want to contribute (Fabric CLI is open source, invite them to try it and even contribute), and mention the upcoming Partner roundtables on Dec 16 & 18 (since those were scheduled) – *“We have smaller roundtable discussions planned in two weeks where we can go deeper and hear your specific feedback and requirements. Please join those if you can.”* This keeps them engaged.  
        Finally, decompress! This is a major event done. You can celebrate quietly after ending the broadcast. Perhaps message your team (Alon/Aviv) that it went well and share any notable questions. It’s likely recorded; you or Stephanie might share the recording in the Partner Voice Teams afterward for those who missed it.  
        **Follow-Up:** In the coming days, check if Stephanie provides a report or if any partner contacts you directly with follow-up queries (some might reach out on LinkedIn or via email). Be responsive – it builds credibility. Also, incorporate any learnings into your plans (e.g., if many partners asked for a certain feature, ensure it’s noted in backlog).  
        Overall, by executing this webcast, you’ve increased awareness of Fabric’s pro dev capabilities and set the stage for interest in MCP’s upcoming preview – a success for you and the team.

**02:00 (Wed) – Office Hours with Architects (PST Afternoon)**  
**Participants:** US-based Fabric architects & engineers (rotating hosts from Redmond), and anyone from the team globally who wants to ask questions. Occurs at 2 AM Haifa time (which is 4 PM PST the previous day). You did not RSVP (likely planning to skip due to time).  
**Objective:** Informal Q\&A session with central architects – typically to discuss architecture questions, best practices, or design feedback in an “office hours” format. For you, there’s no pressing need or expectation to attend, especially given the ungodly hour locally.  
**Context:** These meetings happen weekly (also a morning PST slot exists on Dec 10 7 PM IL, which you also see on calendar). They’re optional and meant as open-forum. Unless you have a specific question to bring (and you likely do not at this moment, plus you need sleep after a long day), you can safely not attend.  
**Preparation:** If you were to attend, you’d prepare a topic or question. But since none is urgent and you haven’t RSVP’d, you can ignore this event. Perhaps ensure no one expects you. If someone mentioned “let’s bring this up at office hours”, then reconsider. But nothing in recent chats indicates that.  
**Recommendation:** Do **not** attend this 2 AM session – you will have had a full day with the Partner webcast ending at 7 PM and tomorrow is busy too. Rest is more valuable. If needed, you can join the next morning’s (Dec 10) office hours at 7 PM IL (which is more feasible and maybe in presence of Kim?). But even that might not need you unless a topic relevant to you arises.  
**Action:** Mark this as *free time*. If you feel guilty, you can check the meeting notes later (often they post a summary or recording). There’s no direct impact on your deliverables from missing this.  
So, use this time to recharge – you’ll skip it unless jetlag keeps you up (which hopefully it doesn’t). If awake and curious, you could dial in just to listen, but prioritizing rest is sensible.

### Wednesday, Dec 3, 2025

**09:00 – AAIC (Internal AI Community Meeting)**  
*(Appears again, likely a recurring daily stand-up or check-in for the AI community? Possibly a quick sync after last night’s lecture?)*  
**Participants:** You (organizer), whoever from team is interested. Probably very few after a late event.  
**Objective:** If this meeting is indeed on the calendar (which it is, as a recurring AAIC daily?), it might be a placeholder or quick chat to recap the lecture or plan next things. Could also just be mis-categorized (the “AAIC” series might include both events and a dummy daily slot). Assuming it’s similar to the Sunday one but on Wednesday. Possibly no one will join if they consider yesterday’s lecture as fulfilling the need.  
**Context & Preparation:** This may not need to occur. If someone shows up (virtually or in office) expecting an AAIC discussion, you can casually chat about last night’s GPT session – “how did it go, what did we learn.” If turnout is zero, no harm – you have other work.  
**Action:** Be available at 9:00 in case (maybe check the AAIC Teams channel to see if anyone mentions anything). Otherwise, treat it as free time or catch up on emails (particularly partner follow-ups from last night).  
**Conclusion:** Minimal involvement here – thus no significant prep beyond having an anecdote from the lecture if needed.

**10:00 – Personal**  
**Participants:** Hasan – personal time (the calendar shows a meeting titled “Personal” at 10–11).  
**Objective:** Possibly a private appointment (doctor, etc.) or just a time block you set aside. Since it’s explicitly marked, likely you needed that hour for something non-work. Ensure your critical tasks don’t conflict.  
**Context:** If this is something like a medical appointment or errand, make sure to attend to it. But given everything happening, confirm it’s something you still need to do. If it’s not urgent, you might consider reclaiming the hour for rest or prepping the day’s meetings. However, work-life balance is important – if it’s a personal commitment, try to keep it.  
**Preparation:** None for work. Just remember to do whatever this is. If it’s an appointment, have any needed documents. If it’s a buffer for personal admin, maybe pay your bills or such then.  
**Impact:** This does not affect others (no one else invited). It’s fine to keep. Just note that at 12:05 you have PM/Eng sync – so be back by then.  
**Plan:** Use this time as intended personally. If finished early, maybe grab a late breakfast or quick power nap (you had a 2AM skip meeting but might still be tired). Essentially, refresh yourself for the mid-day meeting marathon. [\[ AAIC | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwFRAAgI3jH_5v1AAEYAAAAA6D9Em6wj90u1h5WM2_P3bwcA_5YkQF6ffUGaHc1jeoQyPgAAAAABDQAA_5YkQF6ffUGaHc1jeoQyPgAA99Zu6gAAEA%3d%3d)

**12:05 – PM/Engineering Weekly Sync**  
**Participants:** Alon Baram (Organizer, PM Manager), Platform PMs (you, Evelina) and Platform Engineering Leads (Chen Israeli, Ran Didi, Mahir Diab, Alon Yeshurun, Tal, etc. – as listed in the invite roster). Possibly others like Gena (if there’s an arch rep), but based on invite it’s the ILDC leads team.  
**Objective:** Regular weekly sync between the PM and Engineering leads of Fabric Platform. Typically to align on status of ongoing projects, escalate issues, and ensure PM<->Engineering coordination. Given this is the day right before Kim’s on-site, they might also debrief final prep for those meetings.  
**Context:** This meeting usually covers more tactical items than the PM-only sync. Chen and team might update on engineering progress (like “we achieved X, are blocked on Y”). You as PM would update on spec progress and upcoming needs. On Monday you updated in PM Weekly; here you might reiterate some of that for the engineers and see if they have concerns.  
Points likely on the agenda: [\[PM/Enginee...eekly sync | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwFRAAgI3jH_5v1AAEYAAAAA6D9Em6wj90u1h5WM2_P3bwcA_5YkQF6ffUGaHc1jeoQyPgAAAAABDQAA_5YkQF6ffUGaHc1jeoQyPgAA5o6hKAAAEA%3d%3d)

*   **Follow-up from Spec Reviews:** Yesterday’s Hosted MCP review – you should summarize the outcome to the broader group (especially engineers who weren’t there, although Mahir and Chen were). For example: “We got approval on the Hosted MCP spec, basically green light for M0 scope. No major changes requested – just ensure logging is solid and maybe consider an admin toggle. We’ll proceed accordingly.” This informs everyone that project is officially a go.
*   **Today’s Local MCP review (at 3:05 PM):** Preview that it’s coming. If any pre-discussion needed (maybe less, since local MCP is mostly done work, but e.g., if any open question like “should we unify installation with CLI or keep separate extension,” you could mention it now to hear Eng perspective if needed).
*   **Partner Voice recap:** Let them know the partner webcast happened, and share one or two key feedback points. (Engineering might be curious if any partner reported a bug or requested a feature – if so, bring it now. For instance, if a partner asked about pipeline integration, you could say “One question came about connecting CLI to CI pipelines – we should ensure our docs cover that.” Small but shows you’re channeling feedback.) Thank the team members who helped (if any dev helped with demo or content, acknowledge that).
*   **Kim’s Visit – Engineering readiness:** Alon/Aviv will probably ask Chen if everything’s set for demos and discussions with Kim. Possibly they rehearse who will say what in product reviews. You should listen and ensure you know your part (for Automation & Embed review, likely Chen and you will co-present technical and PM aspects). Confirm any demo environment needed for next week is ready (for example, if you plan a live CLI or Copilot demo to Kim). If not asked already, bring it up: e.g., “Do we want to live demo the unified Copilot to Kim? If yes, we should coordinate with Rui’s team to have something stable by then.” (Though likely time is short to add extras – they probably decided the content already.)
*   **Project Status Check-ins:** Quick roundtable on each key item: CLI GA – any new issues since GA? (None major presumably; maybe a quick note if any upcoming version release – Tal might mention if they plan a maintenance release.) Extensibility (Evelina might talk about marketplace timeline). CI/CD (Ran or others might mention pipeline improvements in progress). If any one is lagging or needs product decisions, they’ll raise.
*   **Resource/Team Issues:** If any – e.g., if engineering has a bottleneck or needs PM input. From your side, nothing urgent now (you’re content with support you got for specs, etc.). But if you foresee needing an extra dev for MCP to hit Jan timeline, Chen might mention that now (like shifting someone temporarily).  
    **Preparation:** Not much beyond what you already have – just be ready to summarize partner call and spec review succinctly. Also check if any action from Monday’s PM sync needs follow-up here – did Aviv ask you to do something with engineering? Possibly not beyond what you did (spec/wikis). If your wiki draft is ready, you might inform Chen that you’ll share it for dev feedback soon. (He might assign someone to review it from eng perspective; Yifat or Mahir might be interested.) Could mention: “I’m drafting the workload onboarding guidelines – I’ll share with you all by end of week for input.” This alerts them that a process doc is coming.  
    **Outcome:** Everyone leaves on the same page about current work and immediate events. Engineering knows PM is handling the partner and management comms well (you demonstrating that via the webcast and spec progress). If any issues arose (e.g., an incident or a delay), this meeting would address it. But presumably things are okay this week. Possibly Chen will mention the **Performance incident last week** or something trivial; you mainly listen then.  
    After this, you’ll focus on the Local MCP review at 3:05 and any final Kim visit task.

**15:05 – Fabric Local MCP Spec Review Meeting**  
**Participants:** Same invitees as the Remote MCP review (Alon, Aviv, Evelina, Tal, Chen, Mahir, Yifat, Ran, Amos, Tomer) – maybe slightly different (Rui not invited to these internal ones, as it’s platform). It’s your second half of MCP spec reviews, now for the **Local MCP**.  
**Objective:** Review and finalize the spec for the Local Fabric MCP (which has been partly implemented already as part of VS Code Copilot integration). Align on any enhancements or changes needed and how the local and hosted will coexist. Essentially, confirm there are no remaining questions on local MCP design as we head towards GA/handoff to Copilot team.  
**Context:** The Fabric Local MCP server has been in Private Preview for a while (for Copilot in VSCode). The spec likely documents it formally (tools supported, how it’s distributed, telemetry, etc.), and maybe proposes some improvements (like packaging to nuget, etc., which Arina’s status slide mentioned as done/in progress). Key points to discuss: [\[Fabric Loc...pec Review | Meeting\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meeting/details?eventId=AAMkADQxOTU2MGYwLTlkMmMtNGZlYS1iYmVlLTYzYWIwZjZlODkyYwBGAAAAAADoP0SbrCP3S7WHlYzb4-dvBwD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAAAAAENAAD7liRAXp99QZodzWN6hDI_AAE4Ku0jAAA%3d) [\[Study Guid...Experience | Word\]](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/aspillinger_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B6450A949-48E1-4D43-A8E7-BC728500A51E%7D&file=Study%20Guide%20-%20CLI%20New%20Experience.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

*   **Current State:** Summarize that local MCP exists as a package (npm, nuget, vsix) and is used by internal devs and maybe a few preview customers (Not sure if preview extended outside MS? Possibly limited). Confirm what’s working: as per Arina’s slide, many commands are done (FS commands, config, job mgmt), some are WIP (telemetry onboarding, VSCode extension publishing). Mention those if still relevant. [\[Fabric Aut...ion Status | PowerPoint\]](https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/teams/TridentPublicAPIsauthoring/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B7E81767D-C258-43D7-8FD4-C8A03C107F2D%7D&file=Fabric%20Automation%20Status.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
*   **Plan Forward:** The local MCP is essentially **GA for internal use** (the code is on GitHub open-source). Are we ready to declare it GA externally? According to roadmap, maybe in Build 2026 when Copilot GA. Internally, team might treat it as done aside from maintenance. Ask if any team has feedback; e.g., the RTD team built their own local MCP variant – did we unify those? (One note in chat: Will Thompson said RTI local MCP exists and they’d be test case for unified agent. Maybe ensure our spec accounts for merging any duplicate efforts. Possibly beyond today’s scope, but mention if relevant.) [\[\[PM Spec R...ator Agent | Teams\]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:meeting_ZjkyZWE1YTctZDQ5MC00MmYxLWFiMzMtNGMwNzgxZjNmYTE3@thread.v2/1764003955193?context=%7B%22contextType%22:%22chat%22%7D)
*   **Integration with Hosted MCP:** How do local and hosted MCP interplay? Clarify: local MCP will remain for scenarios requiring local resources (like file access or user’s environment access). Hosted covers service-side tasks. Possibly note that the unified agent in future may call either as needed (but not an immediate problem; for now, Copilot in VS Code calls local, Copilot in service calls hosted). Make sure everyone agrees this split makes sense long-term (they likely do).
*   **Distribution & Support:** Confirm how we plan to ship local MCP updates. Perhaps as part of CLI or VS Code extension. Arina’s data suggests by now we’ve published it to NuGet (for .NET) and will to NPM. Ensure PM/Engineering agrees on the method: one idea is bundling local MCP with CLI installation, but that might not be needed. Another: incorporate local MCP with VS Code extension (which indeed will include it). If any outstanding tasks (like telemetry pipeline for local MCP usage – show if it’s logging usage when used outside VS Code, as originally needed), mention them.
*   **Feedback from users:** If any internal dev or Copilot team gave feedback on local MCP (maybe about performance or missing tools), bring that up to address. For example, maybe the local MCP needed “list files” in Lakehouse which wasn’t originally included – see if that’s requested. Use this meeting to capture any enhancements we should add to local MCP to make it fully robust. Possibly none major because they could use direct API if needed.  
    Given this is the second of two spec reviews, and likely less controversial (because local MCP concept has been proven), this meeting might be shorter or more straightforward. People might even say “We discussed most of the principles yesterday; local is fine as is.”
    **Your Role:** Lead the discussion: you wrote the spec, so highlight any points needing input: e.g., *“One question: Do we want to keep the local MCP as a separate open-source project indefinitely, or eventually converge some code with the hosted? For now it’s separate – which is fine.”* Or *“We propose to mark Local MCP as ‘Developer Preview’ (or GA) for external by Build – any objections or criteria to meet before that?”* (This invites team to set quality bar, e.g., run more tests).  
    **Preparation:** Go over the local MCP spec. Note any differences from remote that might prompt questions: e.g., local MCP doesn’t have the full security layer (it runs as the user offline). Are we comfortable with that? (Yes, because it’s user-run). Possibly offer detail on how local MCP can connect to Fabric: it uses user’s CLI auth or VS Code auth context. Should be fine.  
    **Possible Questions from group:**
    *   *“What’s the overhead of maintaining two MCP codebases?”* – If asked, answer that they share a lot of design, maybe some code generation, but yes they are separate runtime. It’s manageable and expected.
    *   *“Should we unify logging schemas between local and hosted?”* – Yes, likely to ease analysis. If not done, say we will do so (maybe use same event names where applicable).
    *   *“Can customers run the local MCP on their own without VSCode?”* – Technically yes (it’s just an npm or NuGet, they could incorporate it in a custom app). We likely don’t officially support that scenario now beyond experimental. But might in future if demand (like enabling others to build custom agent apps).
    *   *“Will local MCP continue now that hosted exists?”* – Yes, because some scenarios (like local file access or offline development) require it. Also local MCP is the basis for GH Copilot agent in VS Code and maybe Azure DevOps agent integration.  
        **Outcome:** Concurrence that the local MCP spec is acceptable. Possibly an action to ensure documentation is available to internal devs (maybe publish an internal wiki or external if open-source). If any tasks remain (like finishing telemetry, or merging a fork from another team), assign those. But overall, likely a quick thumbs-up.  
        This solidifies the design record for local MCP and again gives leadership confidence to communicate it. (Kim might ask: what about local vs hosted – after these reviews, everyone can answer consistently.)
        After this, your MCP spec duties end – both docs finalized after incorporating any minor feedback from these two meetings. Save them in a repository for future reference.

**16:30 (post-meeting)** – (No specific event, but consider a break or follow-up block)  
After the Local MCP review, you might spend some time incorporating whatever minor feedback you got into both spec docs (v7.0 final) so they’re truly done. Do that while it’s fresh. If feedback was trivial, maybe just note it for later. You’ve now tackled a huge amount of prep the last few days – a small breather is deserved!  
At this point, immediate meetings are done until next week’s on-site. Use the remainder of Wed (and Thu/Fri) to tie up any loose ends: finalize the internal wiki with any guidance gleaned from spec reviews (like if they said “Workload teams can opt-out, you’ll coordinate via config X”, capture that clearly). Perhaps also check on the unified agent spec outcomes from Monday – any tasks for you? (like, say, update MCP to support a certain tool by Feb – add to plan). Also it’s worth sending Kim/visitors a pre-read if needed (was there an email planned? If so, do it by end of week as Alon might want).
And importantly, **rest** where possible. You’ve handled an intense couple of weeks of prep. Being fresh for Kim & Laurent’s visit (Dec 10-11) will let you perform best in those meetings. So gradually shift focus to that: next week you’ll present in the Automation review and the 1:1 with Kim. Start thinking about any materials or demos you need for those, as a final prep step.
