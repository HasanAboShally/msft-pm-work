## Reflect on the Past

### Summary of Impact

As a new PM on the team, my primary core priority was to establish trust in me as a product leader—across our team, with partner teams, and among customers. Trust takes time, but I believe I’ve made strong progress in the right direction.

I broke this goal into four focus areas. Below are the key actions I took in each area, along with the impact those actions delivered.

| **Focus Area** | **What I Did** | **Impact Delivered** |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| **Deliver Customer Value** | - Led the **Fabric CLI** from private preview to GA in under 4 months. Shaped product direction, collaborated on feature design, and engaged deeply in technical discussions with engineering. Ran private preview onboarding, co-presented the public preview at FabCon Las Vegas, presented to Customer/ISV/Partner Voice programs, authored the launch blog (60k+ views), and created the demo video now used across Fabric events. Championed the OSS strategy, presented it to the CTO, and secured approval for the September release. | - 13k+ installs in the first 6 weeks; strong adoption and community feedback (“a game-changer”). The CLI is rapidly becoming a high-visibility dev surface for Fabric, with elevated internal momentum and external recognition. |
| | - Shipped **Direct Lake for Power BI Embedded** and authored launch blog (~50k views). | - Delivered a long-awaited capability enabling real-time analytics at scale for embedded use cases. |
| | - Reframed the **depreciation of the legacy Embed Setup Tool** as a security-driven “retirement”; partnered with CELA and the content team to finalize. | - Increased customer security posture; completed decommission in weeks (vs. typical years), freeing team capacity to ship value. |
| | - Helped **deprecate GitHub issues for client SDKs** and set clearer communication channels. | - Improved customer communication; reduced internal noise and support overhead. |
| **Create Clarity & Leadership Alignment** | - Helped maintain transparency and morale while **navigating pivot** from Fabric Embedded and deprioritization of Power BI Embedded. | - Helped the team stay focused and motivated during significant direction changes. |
| | - Presented a **“What’s next” plan** to the team and leadership to reset direction. | - Re-established alignment and focus across team and stakeholders. |
| | - Created clarity around **Fabric CLI open-source plans** and successfully presented the strategy to the Fabric CTO. | - Gained leadership endorsement and greenlight to proceed with OSS rollout. |
| **Team Operating Rhythm / Trust** | - Built a collaborative **relationship with Alon Yeshurun** and other team members. | - Stronger alignment and communication between PM and engineering. |
| | - Held 1:1 coffee meetings with **engineering team members** and remained approachable for daily unblock. | - Strengthened trust and approachability; supported smoother day-to-day execution. |
| | - Introduced a _**customer-value field**_ in Azure DevOps items. | - Helped the team tie work items to clear customer value. |
| | - Proposed a monthly CLI release cadence as a shared “**success image**”. | - Created a lightweight, visible cadence for progress and team celebration. |
| | - Hosted a festive **CLI kickoff** with Kahoot and Knafeh to boost morale. | - Re-energized the team after roadmap changes; reinforced positive team culture. |
| **Network & Cross-Team Influence** | - Led **Hackathon project** “Harmony”: recruited 7 contributors from across Fabric; reached out to Kim (Fabric VP Product) and others for feedback and visibility. | - Expanded my internal network; seeded an internal initiative around customer voice mining. |
| | - **Co-presented at FabCon** Las Vegas, announcing CLI public preview; engaged with MVPs, partners, and customers. | - Built trust and visibility with key external and internal stakeholders. |
| | - Took **initiative for Microsoft Playground** (Tel Aviv): proposed and began building the “Fabric Quest Room” to showcase CLI and Fabric ILDC work. | - Raising awareness of Fabric and ILDC contributions among employees and customers alike. |
| | - Participated in two **TechTrain** courses: (1) Creating clarity in communication. (2) Leading AI products. | - Sharpened my ability to create clarity for team and leadership. Strengthened my ability to lead AI offerings and features for our org. Networking with additional colleagues to foster cross-team collaboration. |

In addition to the above, I proactively took the lead this semester on helping shape our **team's direction around AI**. Together with Eva, Tal and others, I’ve worked to bring clarity and alignment to what AI can mean for our team and our customers. I applied my strengths in strategy and innovation—zooming out to articulate a coherent high-level story, then zooming in to propose, prioritize, and roadmap concrete solutions. This ongoing work is already influencing our team’s focus areas and is being used to guide upcoming planning and investment discussions.

## Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) Core Priority

- **Hasoub (Board Leadership):** Continued my leadership on the board of Hasoub, the grassroots nonprofit I founded over a decade ago—now the best organization (no bias 😁) working to integrate Arab technologists and entrepreneurs into the Israeli tech ecosystem. Mentored two Arab interns who joined Microsoft ILDC through Hasoub’s network.
- **Arab ERG Involvement:** Co-organized a Ramadan Iftar attended by ~80 Muslim and non-Muslim employees at ILDC. Flagged a scheduling conflict for the ILDC fun-day during Ramadan, which led to rescheduling and broader participation.
- **CLI Accessibility Advocacy (WIP):** Initiated an internal review of GitHub CLI accessibility practices. Drafted a proposal for high-contrast themes and localized error messages to make the Fabric CLI more inclusive.

---

## Security Core Priority

- Adhered to Microsoft’s product security practices and tracked Fabric CLI’s engineering-led **security waves** to ensure product PM alignment.
- Participated in security-sensitive discussions around the **alternative to service principal profiles**, contributing to authentication design considerations.
- Helped smartly and rapidly **retire the legacy Embed Setup Tool**—a decision driven primarily by security risks.
- My prior experience on a Microsoft security team continues to inform my awareness and helps me **raise relevant security considerations** during product planning and design reviews.

## Reflect on a Challenge or Setback

One of the hardest setbacks I experienced this semester was the **deprioritization of both Fabric Embedded**—originally the reason I joined the team—and later, Power BI Embedded, a major business in which I had just begun to invest deeply.

I had two options: react with frustration, or take ownership of what I could control. I chose the latter. I looked for creative ways to still support PBIE indirectly, even though it was no longer the team's core focus. When that didn’t gain traction, I pivoted my energy almost fully into the Fabric CLI. I actively sought feedback from my manager, skip-level, and peers to understand how I could maximize impact for the team. This mindset helped me shift quickly, lead the CLI from private preview to GA, and co-define our AI focus moving forward.

This experience reinforced a key lesson for me: as a PM, I’ve always focused on building products that are desirable, viable, and feasible. But this case was a good reminder that in a large, fast-moving company, _strategic alignment_ is just as critical. Even when a feature or offering checks all the product boxes, it won’t move forward if it doesn’t fit the org’s direction at the right moment.

Going forward, I’m applying this by asking early: _How does this effort connect to the bigger picture?_ I’ve built this lens into my planning process and now make it a priority to surface strategic dependencies from the start—so I can avoid misalignment, build momentum, and help the team stay focused on what matters most.
