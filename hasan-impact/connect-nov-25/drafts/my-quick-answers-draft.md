[@copilot we need to also look around this project, the specs, the notes etc.. and see what else we can inject into the answers of the quesions]


### 1. What results did you deliver, and how did you do it?

*   Include measurable outcomes.
*   Your work in FY26 for your current core priorities will be accounted for in FY26 rewards.
*   Describe your contributions to security, quality, and AI.
*   Reflect on the behaviors that demonstrated our culture.
*   A strong reflection for “what” was achieved clearly highlights your progress and results for each goal, supported by specific, high-impact examples.

[@copilot need to also take my goals from the connect-may-2025.md and show how I accomplished them]


#### CLI:
- Drove open sourcing efforts + now working with issues on github and managing them along with the engineering team.
- CLI downloads = 190K+
- Established strong relationship with top CLI users and advocates (like Kurt Buhler and Peer Grønnerup)
- Drove the definition and delivery of new product features [@copilot: see the cli-release-notes-july-oct.md file]



#### Fabric MCP
- helped define our Fabric MCP strategy and direction and create clarity on what's we're enabling and to who. I strcutured our efforts into 5 buckets and help prioritize and create clarity and excitment among the team, as we're leading meaningful and impactful efforts.
- worked with the microsoft/azure mcp team and delivered public preview of the fabric local mcp. we are the first microsoft team to deliver our server there (we moved fast etc...)
- did customer validation for our mcp efforts, leading customer meetings, feedback collection etc... 
- wrote well desinged specs for the MCPs and starte spec-reviews
- working with multiple fabric workload teams to onboard their MCP tools or build thier onw MCPs (part of the Fabric MCPs Platform effort which I've defined)

### 2. Reflect on recent setbacks – what did you learn and how did you grow?

*   Share specific examples of your setback(s), what you learned, and how you improved.
*   Demonstrate a growth mindset by taking personal accountability, seeking and applying feedback, and using the experience to increase your impact.
*   Focus on how you responded to the challenge and what changed as a result.


The main setback is that the MAU (monthly active users) of the CLI is still not that high (~1500 users).
We need much higher numbers!
I take accountability on not engaging enough with communit leaders who can amplify the cli reach and work with them more closely to increase usage.
and also on not knowing Fabric e2e enough in a deep way that allows me to communicate the value of the CLI in the best way possilbe.

I took action to on several fronts:
- planning how the CLI can be used not just as end tool, but also as 
- took more time learning about the Fabric Persons (to discover that our main persona - the pro developer - is missing from there, and currecntly being defined.)

*   Ensure at least one of your goals supports security at Microsoft.
*   Consider how your goals align with your team’s and organization’s priorities.
*   Think about how your goals will help you grow and increase your impact.




fabric local MCP GA: also add new tools like CLI scripting tool and maybe also deployment planning tool.
fabric remote MCP (public preview) (to suppotr the fabric unified copiloit initiative and also unlock new scenarios for our customers - [@copilot check specs])

CLI in the web, including research and design... to help us decide if we want to pursue it.

CLI V2 (more AI ready + more PBI capabilities...): [@copilot check: /cli/cli-v2.md file)



Define and help build our automation analytics dashboard
