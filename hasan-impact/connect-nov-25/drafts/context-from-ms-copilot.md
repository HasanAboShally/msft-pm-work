**Reflect on the Past (May–Nov 2025):** Over the last six months, I delivered **outstanding results** on my core priorities – significantly advancing our Fabric CLI and Fabric MCP initiatives – while upholding **security**, **quality**, and **AI innovation**, and demonstrating Microsoft’s culture in action.

*   **Expanded Fabric CLI Adoption through Open-Source & Community Engagement:** I led the **open-sourcing of the Fabric CLI** in September, which immediately sparked community contributions and usage growth. I drove this effort end-to-end – securing compliance approvals, preparing the public repo, and announcing it – and now actively manage our GitHub project (triaging issues daily, responding to users, and reviewing external PRs). As a result, we saw our first community pull requests within a week and a noticeable uptick in CLI downloads. I also promoted adoption by partnering across teams to integrate the CLI into other experiences: for example, I worked with the **Fabric Shell and UX teams** on a prototype “**CLI console**” in the web portal, and with the **Notebook and App Dev teams** to ensure the CLI is built into their environments. These integrations make the CLI more accessible and have driven increased usage in customer scenarios. **How I did it:** I showed **customer obsession** by relentlessly gathering and acting on user feedback (e.g. adding top-requested features like JSON output), **One Microsoft collaboration** by working across org boundaries to embed our tool wherever it adds value, and a **bias for action** by boldy championing open-source despite challenges. I also maintained a **security-first mindset**, ensuring all open-source code met compliance standards and initiating work on features like service principal authentication for enterprise security. Thanks to these efforts, Fabric CLI is now a more **widely used, community-driven tool**, reflecting both strong product outcomes and cultural leadership.

*   **Delivered Continuous CLI Improvement & Quality:** I established a **monthly release cadence** for the CLI and shipped five on-time releases (May through September), expanding our feature coverage to \~80% of Fabric scenarios. Each release was high-quality – we had zero critical regression incidents – because I put rigor into planning and testing. I **authored detailed specs** for new capabilities (guided by customer feedback and AI usage trends), unblocked engineers by clarifying requirements and resolving cross-team dependencies quickly, and personally ran final quality checks before launch. Key enhancements included command auto-completion and improved error messages (designed in collaboration with our UX researchers), which improved the user experience and earned praise from early adopters. I also proactively addressed a mid-year **usage plateau**: when we saw CLI usage leveling off in July, I responded by stepping up outreach (blog posts, internal demos) and accelerating those cross-platform integrations mentioned above. This reinvigorated growth by the end of the period. Through these actions, I demonstrated **accountability** (treating the CLI’s success and stability as my personal responsibility), a **growth mindset** (using data and feedback to iterate our approach), and **excellence in quality**. Moreover, I continually tied work to customer value – for instance, prioritizing a feature because an MVP customer needed it for their automation. This focus ensured we delivered **impactful improvements** that resonated with users, while upholding Microsoft’s standards for quality and security (every release passed our security review gates and improved product reliability).

*   **Spearheaded Fabric MCP (AI Automation) & Cross-Team Alignment:** Mid-year, I pivoted to lead the new **Fabric Model Context Protocol (MCP)** effort – a strategic shift towards AI-powered automation for Fabric. I **rapidly ramped up** and took ownership of this initiative, crafting a clear vision and roadmap for how MCP enables Copilot scenarios in Fabric. I rallied our team and partners around this vision by presenting the plan in multiple forums and creating clarity on goals. In early September, we delivered the **Fabric MCP local server** in private preview, on schedule. I coordinated tightly with engineering on its development and onboarded 5+ customers to gather feedback. Achieving this required extensive **cross-organization collaboration**: I worked with the **Copilot team** to align on requirements, the **Fabric platform team** on security and compliance (ensuring the MCP met enterprise security standards from day one), and other PMs to integrate MCP with their services. I also kept our own team motivated and clear on the “why” – hosting knowledge sessions to explain how MCP would unlock future scenarios and sharing customer feedback to celebrate progress. As a result, our MCP preview not only shipped successfully (with positive early feedback from design partners) but also positioned us as leaders in applying **AI** to automation. **How I did it:** I demonstrated **adaptability and initiative** by embracing a new domain and leading it decisively. I leveraged a **One Microsoft** approach, uniting multiple teams towards a common AI goal, and I upheld **accountability** by ensuring even this cutting-edge project followed through on security reviews and quality testing. This effort showcased my ability to **innovate with purpose** – turning a shifting priority into a success – while exemplifying teamwork and customer-focused execution.

*   **Empowered Team and Drove Cultural Excellence:** Throughout these projects, I contributed to a **high-performing, inclusive team culture**. I introduced a simple “customer value” rubric in our backlog grooming, which has everyone now thinking about impact first and has improved how we prioritize work. I frequently stepped in to **mentor and unblock others** – from coaching a new PM on our processes, to quickly resolving an engineer’s roadblock with another group (e.g., negotiating an API change to meet our deadline). I also recognized and celebrated wins (like organizing a small team event after a successful release) to keep morale high. Meanwhile, I actively engaged with our community and customers – answering dozens of questions on forums and setting honest expectations about roadmap changes – thus strengthening trust in our product. These behaviors reflect **Microsoft’s culture**: I showed **customer obsession** (everyone knows I’ll advocate for the user in every decision), practiced **One Microsoft collaboration** (both within and beyond our team), and lived a **growth mindset** by continuously learning and encouraging others to do the same. Importantly, I never lost sight of **quality and security**; for example, I championed added test automation for critical CLI scenarios and made sure our team completed a security threat model for MCP. By modeling these values, I helped the team not only deliver great results but do so in a way that builds trust and excellence.

In summary, my work this period resulted in a **more powerful and popular Fabric CLI, a groundbreaking Fabric MCP preview, and a stronger, more value-driven team**. I achieved these outcomes by taking bold initiative (like open-sourcing our product), executing with discipline and quality, collaborating across boundaries, and constantly aligning our work with customer needs and Microsoft’s standards. I’m proud that I delivered high-impact results **and** did so in a manner that reinforces the culture and security posture we value.

**Setbacks and Lessons:** One challenge I faced was a **plateau in CLI adoption mid-period**. Despite delivering features, we saw usage stagnate around July. Rather than being discouraged, I treated this as a **learning moment**: it became clear that building a great tool isn’t enough – we also need to drive awareness and ease of use. I responded by ramping up outreach (publishing highlights, engaging internal evangelists) and fast-tracking those cross-integrations (so more users encounter the CLI naturally). This turnaround effort worked, as adoption picked up again by fall. The experience taught me to always pair product development with proactive customer engagement and to watch metrics closely. I learned to **anticipate adoption challenges earlier** and address them with the same creativity as a technical problem.

Another setback was the **strategic shift from Power BI Embedded to Fabric MCP**. Mid-year, a portion of my responsibilities (PBIE features) was deprioritized, and I needed to pivot quickly to the new AI initiatives. Initially, this was challenging – it meant letting go of a project I’d invested in. However, I applied a **growth mindset**: I embraced the new focus, convinced it aligned better with the company’s strategy, and dived into learning and leading MCP. This adaptability paid off, as I was able to make significant progress in MCP (which likely had even greater impact than the original plan would have). It reinforced for me the importance of **flexibility and focusing on where I can have the biggest impact**, even if it means changing course. Now I’m even more comfortable navigating changing priorities and turning them into opportunities for success.

These setbacks ultimately **made me a better PM**. I improved my approach to driving adoption, became more strategically agile, and reaffirmed the value of staying positive and solutions-oriented. I’ll carry these lessons forward to continue growing my impact.

**Plan for the Future – Goals (Nov 2025 – Spring 2026):** In the next period, I have set five bold goals that align with our business objectives and include a strong focus on security:

*   **1. Accelerate Fabric CLI Adoption by 50%:** *Grow our CLI’s usage and community.* I will increase **monthly active CLI users by at least 50%** by the end of this period. To achieve this, I plan to deliver another 5 on-time CLI releases with high-value features (targeting >90% workload coverage), integrate the CLI seamlessly into the Fabric web experience (e.g. an in-portal CLI console), and execute a dedicated adoption campaign (tutorials, field enablement). I also aim to have **5+ external contributors’ pull-requests merged** into our CLI project, reflecting a thriving open-source community. *(Business impact: Drives Fabric platform adoption and customer satisfaction by empowering more automation.)*

*   **2. GA the Fabric MCP and Enable Copilot Scenarios:** *Productize our AI-powered automation.* I will lead the Fabric MCP server to **General Availability** and partner with the Copilot team to begin integrating it into a unified Fabric Copilot experience. Success means that by the end of the period, the MCP service is production-ready with **at least 10 customers using it in preview/GA**, and our work has directly enabled at least one end-to-end Copilot scenario (e.g. AI generating Fabric pipelines) in testing. *(Impact: Positions Fabric as an AI-driven platform and opens new value for customers.)*

*   \**3. **Strengthen Security & Reliability of Fabric Automation** (Security Goal):* *Embed security best practices in every deliverable.* I will **maintain zero high-severity security incidents** in the CLI and MCP, and proactively improve our security posture. Specifically, I’ll implement **service principal (SPN) authentication support in the CLI** (allowing more secure, credential-less automation) by mid-period, and ensure every new feature undergoes threat modeling and security review before release. I will also track uptime/quality, aiming for **99.9%+ reliability** for our services and quick turnaround on any critical bugs (target <24h to resolve/block issues). *(Impact: Ensures trust and compliance for our enterprise customers and Microsoft.)*

*   **4. Enhance Fabric User Experience via Integration:** *Make Fabric’s automation tools more accessible.* I will drive **cross-team projects** to embed our capabilities directly into Fabric’s UI and workflows. One key milestone is to deliver a **CLI integration in the Fabric web portal** (e.g., an interactive CLI panel or one-click automation scripts) to preview by mid-year. Another is to integrate Fabric MCP endpoints with existing developer tools (like Azure CLI or VS Code extensions) through collaboration with those teams. The goal is to reduce friction for users – measured by a higher task completion rate for common admin tasks (targeting a 20% improvement once the CLI-in-portal is live). *(Impact: Simplifies the platform experience, increasing adoption and user satisfaction.)*

*   **5. Foster Customer Success and Team Growth:** *Ensure our current customers and team continue to thrive.* I will keep **customer satisfaction high** during our previews and GA – aiming for support feedback scores ≥9/10. This includes maintaining fast response times to customer questions/bugs and providing clear guidance during any changes. Internally, I will **mentor at least 2 junior PMs or new team members**, sharing my knowledge of Microsoft culture and product skills to help them ramp up and succeed. I’ll also continue to improve team processes (like our backlog value rubric and release planning) to boost efficiency. *(Impact: Happy customers, a stronger team, and sustained excellence in execution.)*

Each of these goals is **SMART**, aligned with our org’s priorities (from growth and AI leadership to security), and sets a high bar for success. Achieving them will contribute to key business outcomes – more Fabric adoption, pioneering AI features, robust enterprise trust, and a high-performing team.

**How My Actions & Behaviors Will Drive Success:** I will leverage and amplify the behaviors that have fueled my impact so far, ensuring I reach these goals in a manner that reflects our culture:

*   **Customer Obsession & Curiosity:** I’ll stay closely attuned to users – regularly engaging with our community, analyzing telemetry, and seeking feedback at every stage. By understanding customer needs and pain-points deeply, I can prioritize effectively and deliver solutions that truly resonate (driving adoption and satisfaction for Goal #1 and #5). My curiosity will also push me to explore new ideas (e.g. novel AI uses or integration opportunities) that keep us innovating.

*   **Adaptability & Growth Mindset:** I will remain **flexible and resilient** in the face of new information or changes. If priorities shift or we encounter obstacles, I’ll quickly adjust plans and find a way forward (as I demonstrated with the MCP pivot). I’ll treat setbacks as learning opportunities, applying lessons to improve our approach. This mindset will help me navigate the ambitious AI and integration work (Goal #2 and #4), where we’ll need to iterate rapidly and possibly revise tactics as we learn.

*   **One Microsoft Collaboration:** Achieving these goals requires partnership across many teams, so I will continue to **work openly and collaboratively**. I’ll build strong connections with partner teams (Copilot, Fabric UX, Azure identity, etc.) and coordinate efforts to ensure we’re all moving in the same direction. By harnessing the full breadth of Microsoft’s talent and technology, I can deliver bigger outcomes – like a seamless CLI-in-portal experience or a security feature built with Identity team’s best practices – faster and better. I’ll also foster collaboration within our team, making sure every member feels included and heard in delivering on our objectives.

*   **Bold Initiative & Accountability:** I plan to take **bold steps** – such as proposing creative features or process changes – to accelerate progress, while holding myself accountable to high standards. I won’t hesitate to lead new efforts (for example, if I see an opportunity to improve security or user experience beyond our initial plan, I’ll champion it). At the same time, I will keep a laser focus on quality and ethics: moving fast **with purpose**, not haste. This means rigorously testing our releases, double-checking for compliance, and never cutting corners that could compromise trust. By being courageous in pursuit of excellence, I’ll ensure we hit our targets (and likely exceed some) without sacrificing reliability or integrity.

In essence, I will **lead by example** – showing the curiosity to learn, the courage to innovate, the collaboration to bring others along, and the accountability to deliver the right results the right way. These behaviors have driven my past success, and by doubling down on them, I am confident I will achieve my goals and continue to contribute to Microsoft’s success in a meaningful way.
