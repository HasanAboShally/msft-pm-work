## I. THE WORLD IS CHANGING

### Platforms Are Externalizing Capabilities

Fabric is powerful inside the portal, but increasingly work happens outside it — in CI/CD pipelines, automation scripts, and AI agents. Platforms are externalizing their capabilities to meet users where they are.

**"Embedding Fabric Everywhere"** means exposing Fabric's full capabilities programmatically, so developers can automate and AI agents can operate. This positions Fabric as infrastructure you call, not just a portal you visit — for example, building a data pipeline from ChatGPT or managing deployments from VS Code.

We propose building on our team's strengths — automation, embedding, platform ownership, and MCP infrastructure — to externalize Fabric capabilities and meet users where they are.

### The End of Click-Ops

A fundamental shift is underway in how people interact with platforms.

Instead of navigating portals, clicking through menus, and manually configuring settings, users increasingly expect to **state their intent** and have systems figure out the rest. The evidence is everywhere:

- **Search → Chat**: Users are replacing traditional web searches with conversational AI. A 2024 SparkToro/Datos study found that **58.5% of US Google searches now end in zero clicks** — only 360 out of every 1,000 searches reach the open web [1]. Gartner predicts a **25% decrease in traditional search engine volume by 2026** as AI chatbots and agents absorb queries [2]. Even within search engines, AI-generated summaries are displacing link-clicking behavior.
- **Websites → On-the-fly UI**: The MCP protocol — already adopted by VS Code, Claude, ChatGPT, and thousands of tools — now supports [MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.io): interactive, embeddable UI components served by any tool provider, rendered inline wherever the user is. In just nine months since launch, the Postman 2025 State of the API Report shows **70% of developers are already aware of MCP**, with 10% using it regularly and 24% planning to explore it [3].
- **Portals → Embedded Experiences**: Rather than switching to a platform's portal, users expect the platform to come to *them* — integrated into their IDE, their chat, their workflow.

> **The era of classic portals is at risk.** Platforms that don't externalize their capabilities — both programmatically and experientially — risk becoming invisible in an AI-mediated world.

### What This Means for Fabric

Microsoft Fabric is a **powerful SaaS platform** — and that has brought real strengths: simplicity, unified experience, and accessibility for non-technical users. But today, **not all Fabric capabilities are accessible outside the portal**. To stay relevant, Fabric needs to become fully embeddable and automatable — meeting users wherever they work.

Meanwhile, the world outside is accelerating:

- **76% of developers** use or plan to use AI coding assistants, up from 70% the prior year — with **62% actively using** them today ([Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/ai)) [4]. Among API professionals, the figure is even higher: **89% use generative AI in their daily work** ([Postman State of the API 2025](https://www.postman.com/state-of-api/)) [3]
- **MCP** has been donated to the Linux Foundation (now under LF Projects, LLC), becoming the "HTTP for AI agents" [5]
- Autonomous agents are expected to handle an increasing share of platform operations, from provisioning to troubleshooting. The AI agents market is projected to reach **$52.6 billion by 2030** at a 46.3% CAGR ([MarketsandMarkets, 2025](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/ai-agents-market-15761548.html)) [6]
- Today's API throttling limits (designed for human-scale usage) will face **10–100x pressure** as millions of agents begin interacting with platforms. Already, **51% of developers cite unauthorized or excessive agent API calls** as their top security concern [3]

**If Fabric doesn't adapt, it risks being trapped in a portal-only paradigm while users — and their agents — move on.**

---

## II. OUR THESIS: EMBEDDING FABRIC EVERYWHERE

### The Core Idea

> **Every Fabric capability — whether an operation, a setting, or an experience — should be embeddable, invocable, and composable from wherever users (and their agents) work.**

Today, "Fabric Embed" means embedding a report in a web app. That's a starting point — not the destination.

**Tomorrow, embedding means:**
- A developer troubleshoots a pipeline **from VS Code** — no portal visit needed
- A ChatGPT user provisions a workspace **in-place with a single request**
- An autonomous CI/CD agent **deploys and monitors headlessly**
- A citizen developer builds a data pipeline **inside Copilot**
- An admin configures capacity policies **from a Teams chat**, with Fabric's control plane settings surfacing as an interactive component

This is what we mean by **Fabric Everywhere**: the platform's capabilities — operations, configurations, and rich visual experiences alike — available across every surface where users and agents interact.

### Two Scenarios That Drive Everything

Within this vision, automation falls into two fundamental interaction modes:

| | **Interactive Agents** | **Autonomous Agents** |
|---|---|---|
| **Who** | Human + AI copilot, working together | Software agents operating independently |
| **How** | Conversational, visual, in-context | Headless, API-driven, unattended |
| **Surface** | MCP Apps, embedded UIs, IDE, chat | APIs, CLI, CI/CD pipelines |
| **Examples** | Troubleshooting assistant in VS Code; pipeline builder in Copilot | Nightly deployment agent; capacity scaler; automated governance |
| **Key need** | Rich, discoverable, composable experiences | Reliable, complete, well-governed APIs and tools |

Both modes depend on a shared infrastructure — which is why we need to invest in **three layers**.

### Two Types of Consumers That Use Fabric

In the agentic era, platforms serve two distinct consumer types:

| Consumer | Description | What They Need |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **👤 Human Users** | Data engineers, analysts, admins who interact through portals, IDEs, chat, Teams, and the **tools they build** (scripts, CI/CD pipelines, Terraform, PowerShell) | Rich, visual, discoverable experiences wherever they work — plus complete, reliable APIs for the automation tools they create |
| **🤖 AI Agents** | Software agents that discover and call Fabric operations via MCP — a **new standalone consumer** | Discoverable tools, proper identity (SPNs), scoped permissions, audit trails |

> **Note**: Scripts, pipelines, and scheduled jobs are **tools that humans use** to extend their reach — not a separate persona. The same foundational infrastructure (APIs, CLI, MCP) serves both human-built automation and AI agents.

AI agents further break down into two sub-types:
- **Interactive agents**: Human + AI copilot working together in conversation (MCP Apps, Copilot in VS Code)
- **Autonomous agents**: Operate independently — monitoring, deploying, governing without human in the loop

> **AI agents are not just tools — they are standalone consumers** with their own identity, permissions, and audit trails, deserving the same first-class treatment as human users.

```

> **Key insight**: Each layer delivers value on its own. The Foundational Layer enables programmatic automation *today*. The Programmatic Layer serves thousands of customers who use scripts, CI/CD, and IaC — no AI required. The Agentic Layer adds intelligence on top. You don't need to wait for agents to benefit from this investment.

### Layer 1: The Foundational Layer

> **Build the infrastructure of tomorrow — not just for today's human users, but for tomorrow's scripts, pipelines, and millions of agents.**

This layer is the prerequisite for everything. Without solid, complete, future-proof infrastructure, no programmatic automation or agentic experience will work.

**What belongs here:**

| Component | Current State | What's Needed |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **APIs** | 110K MAU, growing 13% MoM — but incomplete coverage, severe throttling (10 calls/min) | **API-first completeness**: every UI action must have an API equivalent. Throttling redesigned for agentic scale (10 → 200 → future-proof for 100x agent volume) |
| **CLI** | 1.4K MAU, 168K downloads, growing 17% MoM | **Execution layer for agents**: composable, scriptable, easier for agents to use than raw APIs. Closes API gaps through composition |
| **MCP Infrastructure** | Local MCP launching GA (FabCon Mar 2026); Remote MCP in development | **Universal connectivity**: hosted MCP server for external agents, local MCP for IDE-based workflows |
| **SDKs** | .NET GA, Python in preview | **Language parity**: Python SDK GA, Swagger/OpenAPI publish |
| **Terraform Provider** | 489 MAU, growing | **IaC coverage**: 100% resource coverage for all GA items |
| **Identity & Governance** | SPN support partial, throttling inadequate | **Agent-ready identity**: SPNs for agents, fine-grained scopes, audit trails for every agent action |

#### Critical Point: Build for Tomorrow's Scale

> Today's throttling limits are set for human-scale usage. But in the agentic future, **millions of agents** will interact with Fabric — deploying, monitoring, querying, provisioning. If we design our foundational layer for current traffic patterns, we will be caught off-guard within 2–3 years.
>
> **We need to design our infrastructure for the 100x world.**

#### Side Note: Validate the API-First Assumption

While we strongly believe API-first is essential, it's worth a quick validation step: could architects explore whether agentic experiences can be fully enabled *without* API-first? (We suspect not — especially for programmatic automation — but a brief exploration could strengthen the argument or surface emerging alternatives.)

#### Side Note: CLI as Execution Layer

The CLI deserves special consideration as a **parallel execution layer** alongside APIs. It's more composable, easier for agents to parse and chain, and can bridge API gaps. We plan a dedicated discussion on this in the coming weeks. For the strategy, the CLI sits at the top of the foundational layer — an interface on top of the APIs that makes them more accessible to both humans and agents.

---

### Layer 2: The Programmatic Automation Layer

> **Unlock reliable, repeatable automation for scripts, CI/CD, IaC, and scheduled workflows — delivering immediate value today.**

This layer represents the "classic" automation that many customers already use and will continue to need. It's powered by the Foundational Layer and delivers value independently of AI or agents.

**What this layer enables (the use cases):**

| Use Case | Description | How It's Done |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Provisioning** | Create and configure workspaces, items, and resources | Terraform, APIs, CLI, scripts |
| **CI/CD & Deployment** | Automated, repeatable deployment workflows | GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, CLI |
| **Access & Governance** | Manage permissions, policies, and compliance | APIs, PowerShell, Terraform |
| **Bulk Operations** | Mass updates, migrations, and batch changes | Scripts, CLI, APIs |
| **Monitoring** | Track health, performance, and usage | APIs, scheduled jobs, scripts |
| **Scheduling** | Timed automation for data refresh and maintenance | Scheduled jobs, CI/CD pipelines |

**Why this layer matters**: Many customers will use programmatic automation long before they adopt AI agents — and many will continue using both side by side. A strong programmatic layer is not "legacy" — it's the backbone of production operations. It also provides the patterns and interfaces that AI agents will leverage when they arrive.

---

### Layer 3: The Agentic Layer

> **Deliver intelligent, embeddable experiences — both interactive and autonomous — powered by the foundational and programmatic layers.**

This is where the value becomes visible to users and the organization. The agentic layer comprises three workstreams:

#### Workstream A: Interactive Agent Experiences (Embedding Fabric)

**The idea**: Externalize Fabric's capabilities as rich, embeddable experiences — not just APIs, but interactive UI components — that work wherever users are.

**The mechanism**: MCP Apps and equivalent technologies allow servers to serve rich, interactive UI components inline within any host (VS Code, ChatGPT, Claude, Teams, custom apps). Today we embed reports. Tomorrow we can embed:

| What We Embed | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| **Monitoring & Troubleshooting** | An MCP App that surfaces pipeline logs, identifies errors, and proposes fixes — rendered inline in VS Code or ChatGPT |
| **Control Plane Settings** | Capacity configuration, workspace permissions — interactive UIs served to any host |
| **Data Pipeline Builder** | Visual pipeline authoring experience — currently portal-only — available as an embedded component anywhere |
| **Workspace Provisioning** | AI-guided setup flow: describe your needs, see a visual preview, confirm and deploy |
| **Reports & Analytics** | Already today (Fabric Embed), expanding to more item types |

**Why this is natural for our team**: We already own Fabric Embed (currently reports/items). Expanding from embedding items to embedding *any Fabric experience* is a logical, high-impact evolution of our charter.

#### Workstream B: Autonomous Agent Access (Headless Fabric)

**The idea**: Make every Fabric operation accessible to autonomous agents — agents that operate without human interaction, running CI/CD, provisioning, monitoring, and governance tasks.

**Key components**:
- **Hosted MCP Server**: A unified, authenticated endpoint exposing all Fabric operations as MCP tools. External agents (GitHub Copilot, Claude, Azure AI, custom agents) connect and operate.
- **Agent Identity**: Agents are first-class personas with proper Entra ID integration, SPNs, scoped permissions, and audit trails. Every agent action goes through the same permission checks as a human user.
- **Governance Controls**: Admin controls to approve/restrict agent access, define operation scopes, enforce read-only modes.

**The promise**: *Anything you can do in the Fabric portal, an agent can do via our infrastructure — securely, auditably, at scale.*

> **Industry reality**: The Postman 2025 State of the API Report (5,700+ respondents) finds that while 89% of developers use AI tools, **only 24% design APIs with AI agents in mind** — 60% still design primarily for humans only [3]. This is the gap we must close for Fabric.

#### Workstream C: Customer MCP Tools (Fabric as an Operational Platform)

**The idea**: Let customers expose their own business logic — notebooks, pipelines, stored procedures — as MCP tools that any agent (internal or external) can discover and invoke.

**Key components**:
- **MCP Server Item**: A new Fabric item type — a container of custom tools hosted by Fabric
- **Publish as MCP Tool**: Wrap any Fabric item (notebook, pipeline, stored procedure) with a name, description, and parameters → it becomes callable by any agent
- **Discoverability**: Custom tools appear in MCP catalogs, usable by Copilot, external agents, and other tools

**Example**: A finance team wraps their proprietary "ComputeFinanceMetric" process as an MCP tool. Now, when anyone (or any agent) needs that metric, it's a single invocation — no manual notebook execution required.

**Why this matters**: It transforms Fabric from an *analytics platform* into an **operational platform** — organizations codify their business-specific operations and make them callable by AI.

## IV. GROUNDED IN REAL PAIN: THE EVIDENCE

### CAT Professional Developer Research (Nov 2025)

The most comprehensive developer research in Fabric history provides the evidence base for this strategy:

- **56 hours** of 1:1 interviews with professional developers across 50+ organizations
- **220 unique issues** extracted, mapped to Jobs-to-Be-Done
- **110 pro-devs surveyed** for opportunity analysis
- **13 underserved jobs** identified through JTBD opportunity scoring

**Who is a professional developer on Fabric?**
> "Builds and operates production-grade, governed, and automated data solutions on Microsoft Fabric as a core part of their role. Works across multiple workloads. Applies software engineering rigor (Git, CI/CD, testing, governance, security). Beyond the 85th percentile in regular Fabric usage."

### The Four Underserved Priority Areas

| Priority Area | Underserved Jobs | Top-Ranked Improvements | Strategy Layer |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **🔴 CI/CD & Deployment** | Implement CI/CD & automated deployment; Deploy data systems | Improve deployment pipeline speed, reliability, artifact support; Strengthen Git integration; Cross-workspace deployment tools | Foundational |
| **🔴 Monitor & Troubleshoot** | Troubleshoot performance issues (**opportunity score: 6.1 — highest**); Monitor system performance; Manage and monitor usage/capacity | Enhance monitoring speed, reliability, alerting; Proactive pipeline alerts; Un-silo monitoring tools; Improve error messages | All three layers |
| **🟡 Optimization & Capacity** | Optimize resource spend; Plan for future capacity needs; Design data systems | Expose capacity costs; Enable flexible cost breakdowns; Guard against cost overages | All three layers |
| **🟡 Access & Identity** | Manage and monitor access | Enable service accounts; Automate identity and access management | Foundational |

### What Professional Developers Told Us (Direct Quotes from CAT)

**On Monitoring & Troubleshooting:**
> *"Logs are scattered across multiple tools (Pipeline, Spark, Eventhouse), making root cause analysis slow and error-prone."*
>
> *"No scalable, centralized alerting for pipeline or notebook failures; alerts are unreliable, forcing teams to build custom notification systems."*
>
> *"Issues like Spark memory failures, concurrency errors, and capacity overloads are hard to diagnose due to vague error messages and missing execution metrics."*

**On CI/CD & Deployment:**
> *"Deployment pipelines are slow and manual, with limited automation."*
>
> *"Git integration is not fully supported for deployments, leading to reliance on point-and-click interface and manual workarounds."*
>
> *"Preview features aren't Git-ready before release, creating technical debt."*

**On Identity:**
> *"Without service accounts or managed identity support, processes need to run under individual user credentials."*
>
> *"Artifacts tied to individual user accounts break when users leave."*

### The Satisfaction Gap

| Metric | Value | Implication |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **API MAU** | 110K (+13% MoM) | Professional developers are Fabric's most active automation users |
| **MAT coverage** | ~90% of Fabric customers use automation | This isn't a niche — it's nearly universal |
| **Heavy user NPS** | **12** (vs. 42 overall) | The more you use Fabric, the less satisfied you are |
| **Underserved jobs** | 13 out of 33 | 40% of developer jobs are underserved |

> **Translation**: Our most engaged, most valuable users — the ones who automate, scale, and productionize — are our *least satisfied*. This is both a crisis and an opportunity.

---

## V. MAKING IT REAL: THE TROUBLESHOOTING EXAMPLE

To show what "Embedding Fabric Everywhere" looks like in practice, let's walk through one pain point end-to-end: **Troubleshooting** — the #1 underserved job (opportunity score: 6.1).

### Today's Experience (The Pain)

A data engineer's pipeline fails at 2 AM:

1. Open the Fabric portal
2. Navigate to the workspace → find the pipeline → open run history
3. Find the failed run → look at vague error message
4. Switch to a different tab → open Azure Monitor
5. Search through scattered logs across Spark, Pipeline, Eventhouse
6. Manually correlate timestamps between tools
7. Google the error message → find a community post from 2024
8. Try a fix → redeploy → wait → check again

**Time to resolution: hours. Satisfaction: miserable.**

> Research by Gloria Mark at UC Irvine shows it takes an average of **23 minutes and 15 seconds** to refocus on a task after an interruption [7]. Each context switch between tools — portal, Azure Monitor, Spark logs, browser — compounds this cost. A single troubleshooting session with 5+ tool switches can waste over an hour in refocusing alone.

### Tomorrow's Experience: Foundational Layer

We invest in the infrastructure:

- **Logging API**: A unified API that aggregates logs from Azure Monitor, workspace monitoring, and Fabric-internal telemetry
- **CLI command**: `fab monitor logs --workspace <ws> --item <pipeline> --last-run` — one command, all relevant logs, structured output
- **Error enrichment API**: Errors come with context, suggested causes, and linked documentation

### Tomorrow's Experience: Agentic Layer

Built on top of the foundational layer:

**Interactive agent (MCP App in VS Code):**
The developer opens VS Code. Copilot detects the pipeline failure and surfaces an MCP App inline:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔴 Pipeline Failure: ETL-Finance-Daily     │
│                                             │
│  ⏰ Failed at: 2:14 AM · Run #4,271        │
│  📍 Stage: Data Transform (Step 3 of 7)    │
│                                             │
│  ┌─ Root Cause Analysis ──────────────────┐ │
│  │ Memory overflow in Spark executor       │ │
│  │ Input data grew 3.2x from yesterday    │ │
│  │ Confidence: 87%                        │ │
│  └────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
│                                             │
│  💡 Recommended Actions:                    │
│  [Increase executor memory]                 │
│  [Add data partitioning]                    │
│  [View full logs]                           │
│                                             │
│  The user clicks "Increase executor memory" │
│  → Agent applies the change via API            │
│  → Pipeline re-triggered automatically          │
│  (with user approval / configurable guardrails) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Autonomous agent (CI/CD integration):**
A monitoring agent detects the failure, pulls logs via CLI, identifies the root cause, applies a predefined remediation (increase memory), re-triggers the pipeline, and notifies the team in Slack — all without a human waking up.

### Why This Example Matters

| Layer | What It Required | Status Today |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Foundational** | Unified logging API, CLI command, error enrichment | ❌ Logs scattered, CLI can't access monitoring, vague errors |
| **Programmatic** | Scriptable monitoring and remediation workflows | ❌ No unified CLI for logs, manual scripting required |
| **Agentic (Interactive)** | MCP App for inline troubleshooting with agent-executed actions | ❌ Doesn't exist — must go to portal |
| **Agentic (Autonomous)** | Agent-accessible monitoring, remediation APIs, configurable guardrails | ❌ No agent can troubleshoot or remediate on behalf of user |

**This one example shows why we need all three layers — and why embedding is the right mental model.** The troubleshooting *experience* is embedded wherever the developer is. The programmatic *automation* makes it scriptable. The *infrastructure* is what makes it all possible.

---

## VI. ANOTHER EXAMPLE: VISUAL EXPERIENCES BEYOND THE PORTAL

Some Fabric experiences are inherently visual — building a data pipeline, for instance, involves spatial arrangement of steps, visual connection of inputs/outputs, and real-time preview of transformations.

Today, this is portal-only. But with MCP Apps and embedding:

- A user in **ChatGPT** says "Create a pipeline that ingests from Blob Storage, transforms with Spark, and loads to Lakehouse" → an interactive pipeline builder renders *inline in the chat* — the user drags, adjusts, confirms, and it deploys
- A user in **VS Code** describes the same flow → Copilot generates the YAML representation *and* shows a visual preview as an MCP App side-by-side
- A **citizen developer in Teams** asks for help setting up a data flow → gets a step-by-step wizard, embedded right in the conversation

> **The insight**: Externalizing UI-intensive experiences — not just APIs — is what makes Fabric truly embeddable. This is beyond "headless" — it's **"heads-everywhere."**

---

## VII. END-TO-END SCENARIOS

The three-layer architecture isn't abstract. Here are three concrete user journeys that show how the layers work together — each from a different persona, in a different surface, solving a real problem.

### Scenario 1: Developer Troubleshooting from VS Code

**Persona**: Sarah, Senior Data Engineer  
**Where**: VS Code with GitHub Copilot  
**Goal**: Diagnose and fix a failing Spark notebook without opening the Fabric portal

1. Sarah's CI/CD pipeline fails with a vague Spark error. She opens VS Code and asks Copilot: *"Why did my Spark notebook fail in the Production workspace?"*
2. Copilot invokes the **Fabric MCP tools** to pull the latest run logs and error details from the Fabric workspace.
3. The agent analyzes the logs and identifies a memory configuration mismatch — the notebook's Spark pool doesn't have enough executor memory for the new data volume.
4. Copilot suggests a fix: update the Spark pool configuration. Sarah approves.
5. The agent executes the change via the **CLI** (or API) — updating the pool settings without Sarah ever leaving VS Code.
6. Copilot re-triggers the notebook run through the **API** and monitors the result.
7. The run succeeds. Sarah commits the updated configuration to Git and moves on — **total time: 4 minutes** vs. 20+ minutes of portal navigation.

**Layers used**: Foundational (APIs, CLI, logs) → Programmatic (CI/CD trigger, scriptable config) → Agentic (Copilot-driven interactive troubleshooting)

### Scenario 2: Business User Creating a Report from Claude Desktop

**Persona**: David, Marketing Analytics Manager  
**Where**: Claude Desktop with Fabric MCP  
**Goal**: Build a campaign performance report without learning the Fabric portal

1. David opens Claude Desktop and says: *"I need a report showing our Q4 marketing campaign performance — impressions, conversions, and ROI by channel."*
2. Claude invokes the **Fabric MCP** to discover available semantic models and lakehouses in David's workspace.
3. The agent finds the `Marketing_Analytics` semantic model and lists the relevant measures and dimensions.
4. Claude suggests a report layout: a bar chart for impressions by channel, a conversion funnel, and an ROI table. David says *"Add a trend line for week-over-week."*
5. The agent creates the report via the **API**, applying David's customizations.
6. Claude returns a link to the live report in Fabric — David can share it directly with his team.
7. David asks *"Schedule this to refresh every Monday morning"* — the agent sets up the refresh schedule via the **API**.

**Layers used**: Foundational (APIs, semantic model access) → Programmatic (automated refresh scheduling) → Agentic (Claude-driven interactive creation)

### Scenario 3: Autonomous CI/CD Agent in GitHub Actions

**Persona**: None (fully autonomous)  
**Where**: GitHub Actions  
**Goal**: Deploy workspace changes, run validation, and roll back if tests fail — with zero human intervention

1. A developer merges a PR that updates a Spark notebook and a pipeline definition.
2. GitHub Actions triggers the deployment workflow. The **CI/CD agent** authenticates to Fabric using a Service Principal.
3. The agent calls the **Fabric API** to deploy the updated items to the Staging workspace.
4. The agent invokes the **CLI** to run the validation pipeline: `fab pipeline run --workspace Staging --pipeline ValidationSuite`.
5. The validation pipeline completes with 2 test failures. The agent pulls the test results via the **API**.
6. Based on the failure policy (configured in the workflow YAML), the agent automatically rolls back the Staging workspace to the previous version.
7. The agent posts a summary to the PR: *"Deployment rolled back — 2 validation failures detected. See attached test report."* The developer reviews and fixes.

**Layers used**: Foundational (APIs, SPN identity, CLI) → Programmatic (CI/CD pipeline, scriptable deployment & rollback) → Agentic (autonomous decision-making, zero human intervention)

### Why These Scenarios Matter

Each scenario demonstrates a different point on the automation spectrum:

| Scenario | Automation Level | Human Involvement | Key Enablers |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Developer in VS Code** | Interactive (human-in-the-loop) | Approves each step | MCP tools, CLI, APIs |
| **Business User in Claude** | Guided (AI suggests, human refines) | Provides intent, reviews output | MCP discovery, APIs, semantic models |
| **CI/CD Agent in GitHub** | Autonomous (zero-touch) | Reviews after the fact | SPN identity, APIs, CLI, governance policies |

> **The key insight**: The same three layers power all three scenarios. The difference is the level of human involvement — which is configurable, not hard-coded.
>
> **Bottom line**: Fabric powers the outcome, even when users never open the portal.

## VIII. WHY US

### We Own the Infrastructure This Vision Requires

| What We Already Own | Why It Matters for This Vision |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Fabric Embed** | We already embed Fabric items (reports) into external apps. This vision *extends* that to embed any Fabric experience. |
| **Fabric MCP (Local + Hosted)** | We own both the local MCP (launching GA at FabCon March '26) and the hosted/remote MCP server — the infrastructure that enables interactive and autonomous agent access. |
| **MCP Platform** | We provide the MCP infrastructure for additional Fabric teams — enabling any workload team to expose their capabilities as MCP tools without building their own server. |
| **Public APIs** | We own the foundational layer itself — the APIs that everything is built upon. |
| **CLI** | We own the composable execution layer that sits above APIs. |
| **SDKs & Terraform** | We own the developer tools that professional developers use today. |

No other team has this combination. We are the **only team** that owns both the foundational infrastructure (APIs, CLI, SDKs) *and* the embedding/externalization surface (Embed, MCP, control plane).

### What We're NOT

To be clear, we are not:
- The **in-product Copilot team** (they own Blueprint, Creator Agent, in-product Copilot UX)
- The **CI/CD team** (Nimrod Shalit owns Deployment Pipelines, Git Integration, Variables)
- The **developer acquisition team** (AppDev owns VS Code extension adoption, freemium)

We are the **infrastructure team that enables all of these** — and the team that externalizes Fabric beyond the portal.

## IX. FROM VISION TO EXECUTION: KEY WORKSTREAMS

Here's how the three layers translate into concrete work areas. The previous 5 directions are not abandoned — they're reorganized under the layer model where they naturally belong.

### Foundational Layer Workstreams

| Workstream | Description | Key Deliverables | Timeline |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **API Completeness & Quality** | Every UI action must have an API. Fix throttling, SPN coverage, batch operations. | Throttling: 10 → 200 calls/min (near-term), future-proofed architecture for 100x; 100% SPN coverage; Batch Export/Import API | 2026 (P0) |
| **CLI as Execution Layer** | Make CLI the preferred interface for agents and power users. Composable, scriptable, bridges API gaps. | CLI open source; extensions framework; `fab monitor`, `fab deploy` commands; CLI-in-Notebook | 2026–2027 |
| **MCP Infrastructure** | Build the universal connectivity layer for agents. | Local MCP GA (FabCon Mar 2026); Remote/Hosted MCP server; workload MCP framework | 2026–2027 |
| **SDKs & Terraform** | Complete the developer toolkit. | .NET SDK GA; Python SDK GA; Terraform 100% coverage; Swagger publish | 2026–2027 |
| **Identity & Governance** | Make agents first-class citizens with proper identity. | Agent SPNs; scoped permissions; audit trails for agent actions; admin controls | 2026–2027 |

### Programmatic Layer Workstreams

| Workstream | Description | Key Deliverables | Timeline |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **CI/CD & Deployment Automation** | Enable reliable, scriptable deployment workflows | GitHub Actions integration; CLI-based deployment commands; Cross-workspace deployment | 2026–2027 |
| **IaC Coverage** | Full Terraform and declarative infrastructure support | Terraform 100% coverage for GA items; Swagger/OpenAPI publish; Blueprints as Code | 2026–2027 |
| **Scripting in Fabric** | Bring automation into the portal for admins and citizen developers | Script Item type; Copilot Script Mode; Schedulable, auditable scripts | 2026–2027 |

### Agentic Layer Workstreams

| Workstream | Description | Key Deliverables | Timeline |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Interactive Embedding (MCP Apps)** | Externalize Fabric experiences as embeddable, interactive components. | Troubleshooting MCP App (proof-of-concept); Embedded monitoring; Control plane settings as interactive components | 2027–2028 |
| **Autonomous Agent Access** | Enable headless operation of Fabric by external agents. | Hosted MCP Server (PuPr 2027, GA 2027); Agent governance controls; Read-only modes | 2027 |
| **Customer MCP Tools** | Let customers publish their business logic as callable operations. | MCP Server Item; Publish-as-MCP-tool flow; Tool discoverability in Copilot | 2027–2028 |
| **Scripting in Fabric** | Bring automation into the portal for admins and citizen developers. | Script Item type; Copilot Script Mode; Schedulable, auditable scripts | 2026–2027 |
| **AI-Powered Provisioning** | Make workspace setup declarative, repeatable, and AI-assisted. | Enhanced Blueprints; Blueprints as Code (IaC); AI-generated Blueprints from natural language | 2026–2028 |

### How We Work: Parallel Streams

These aren't sequential phases — they're **parallel streams** that compound over time. Each layer delivers value independently, but they accelerate each other:

| Stream | Focus | How It Compounds |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| **Foundation** | APIs, CLI, SDKs, Identity | Every API we complete = one more thing agents and scripts can do |
| **Programmatic** | CI/CD, Terraform, Scripting | Every workflow automated = one less portal dependency |
| **Agentic** | MCP Platform, MCP Apps, MCP Tools | Every MCP tool published = one more surface where Fabric lives |

> **The compounding effect**: A completed API (Foundation) enables a CLI command (Foundation) which enables a CI/CD action (Programmatic) which enables an agent tool (Agentic). Each layer amplifies the next.

---

## X. BUILDING BLOCKS

The vision needs concrete building blocks to become real. These are the efforts — organized by layer — that bridge strategy to execution. Each block can be owned, scoped, and delivered independently.

### Foundation Building Blocks

| Building Block | Description | Why It Matters |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Internal API Tooling** | Infrastructure for API completeness: gap analysis, spec generation, documentation, and quality validation | Enables use cases across all layers — every API completed = one more thing agents can do |
| **CLI v2** | Open-source, extensible CLI with plugin framework and composable commands | The execution layer for both humans and agents |
| **SDK Expansion** | .NET SDK GA, Python SDK GA, complete language coverage | Professional developers need native-language tools |
| **Identity & SPN** | Agent-grade Service Principal support with scoped permissions and audit trails | Agents can't operate without proper identity |
| **Monitoring APIs** | Unified logging, metrics, and diagnostics APIs | Powers troubleshooting scenarios across all three layers |

### Programmatic Building Blocks

| Building Block | Description | Why It Matters |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Terraform Provider** | 100% coverage for GA items, declarative infrastructure management | Enterprise IaC is table-stakes |
| **CI/CD Toolkit** | GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps tasks, deployment CLI commands | Reliable, scriptable deployments |
| **Scripting in Fabric** | Script Item type with Copilot Script Mode, schedulable and auditable | Brings automation to portal users |

### Agentic Building Blocks

| Building Block | Description | Why It Matters |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **MCP Platform** | Infrastructure for any Fabric workload team to expose MCP tools | Scales agent access across all of Fabric, not just our team |
| **MCP Apps** | Interactive, embeddable Fabric experiences (troubleshooting, monitoring, provisioning) | Makes Fabric visual and interactive outside the portal |
| **MCP Tools Library** | Curated, tested set of MCP tools covering core Fabric operations | Lowers the barrier for agent developers to integrate Fabric |

### Where We Think We Should Start

These are **proposed starting points** — not a committed plan. First, we align on the vision and strategic direction.

1. **API Completeness Sprint** — Close the top 20 API gaps blocking CLI, SDK, and agent scenarios
2. **CLI v2 Open Source** — Ship the extensible CLI framework that becomes the execution layer
3. **MCP Platform MVP** — Enable one additional Fabric workload team to publish MCP tools
4. **Troubleshooting MCP App** — Build the proof-of-concept that demonstrates all three layers end-to-end

> ⚠️ **Note**: This is not a full plan yet. The building blocks above need owners, timelines, and dependencies. The purpose of this section is to show the *shape* of the work — so we can align on direction before committing resources.

---

## XI. THE DEMOCRATIZATION ANGLE

Embedding Fabric Everywhere isn't just about professional developers. It's about **every Fabric user**.

| User Type | How Embedding Helps | Example |
|-----------|--------------------|---------| 
| **Professional Developer** | Stays in VS Code/IDE, uses CLI + MCP tools, never needs the portal for routine operations | Troubleshoots from VS Code, deploys via CI/CD agent |
| **Scripts & Pipelines** | Reliable, scriptable automation using CLI, APIs, and IaC providers | CI/CD deploys workspace via Terraform; scheduled script monitors capacity |
| **Citizen Developer** | Gets AI-assisted automation without needing to code or navigate complex UIs | Describes a task in Copilot → Script Mode generates and runs it |
| **Admin / CoE Leader** | Manages governance through embedded control plane experiences | Configures capacity policies from Teams; applies Blueprint templates |
| **New Developer** | Gets guided, interactive setup experiences wherever they start | AI-guided workspace provisioning in ChatGPT |
| **AI Agent** | Operates Fabric headlessly as a first-class consumer | Autonomous deployment, monitoring, remediation |

> **The key insight**: By embedding Fabric's capabilities (not just its data), we make the platform accessible to users who would never navigate the portal — and more efficient for those who do.

---

## XII. FUTURE-PROOFING: WHY NOW

### The Urgency Argument

This is not a "nice to have in 3 years" strategy. The window is now:

1. **MCP is crystallizing**: The protocol is rapidly becoming the standard for AI-tool interaction. Early adopters (Stripe, Shopify, GitHub) are setting expectations. If Fabric is late, users will build workarounds — or leave.

2. **Agent adoption is accelerating**: While customer adoption of AI agents in production is still early, the industry push is massive. It will arrive sooner than we think. We need the infrastructure *before* the demand spike.

3. **Competitive landscape**: AWS, Snowflake, and Databricks have all shipped MCP servers — but with important limitations. **Snowflake's MCP is data-chat only** (query and explore data via Cortex AI) — no operational capabilities like provisioning, deployment, or monitoring. **Our differentiation is operational breadth**: Fabric MCP can cover the full platform operations surface (workspace management, CI/CD, monitoring, governance) — not just data interaction. We already match competitors on data-chat via Copilot and RTI MCP. The Postman 2025 report confirms that **82% of organizations have adopted API-first approaches** (up 12% from 2024), with the report explicitly noting that "API strategy is fast becoming AI strategy" [3]. We have a unique advantage, but that advantage is time-limited.

4. **Internal alignment**: Fabric IQ, Unified Copilot, and the Krypton memo all point in this direction. The organizational momentum is here — now we need to capitalize on it.

### The Cost of Inaction

| If We Don't Act | Consequence |
|-----------------|-------------|
| APIs stay incomplete | Agents can't operate Fabric → developers build workarounds or choose competitors |
| Throttling stays human-scale | First wave of agent adoption hits immediate walls → bad reputation |
| Experiences stay portal-only | Users spend 10+ hours/week on click-ops that could be automated — McKinsey estimates generative AI can boost software engineering productivity by **20–45%**, but only when automation infrastructure exists [8] |
| No embedding beyond reports | Fabric stays invisible in IDE/chat workflows → diminishing mindshare |

---

## XIII. SUCCESS METRICS

### What We're Tracking

| Metric | Current (2025) | 2027 Target | 2029 Target |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **API MAU** | 110K | 200K | 300K |
| **CLI MAU** | 1.4K | 15K | 30K |
| **Developer NPS (heavy users)** | 12 | 40 | 50+ |
| **External MCP connections** | 0 | 5K | 25K |
| **Agent-initiated operations** | 0% | 15% | 30% |
| **Time to first deployment** | Hours | 15 min | <10 min |
| **API throttling complaints** | High | -80% | Near zero |
| **Embedded experiences (beyond reports)** | 0 | 3 | 10+ |

---

## XIV. STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT

### How This Connects to Leadership Priorities

| Priority | How "Embedding Fabric Everywhere" Delivers |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Kim's P1.6**: "Delightful developer experiences" | Fix foundations (APIs, CLI, SDKs) → embed Fabric in developer tools → NPS 12 → 50+ |
| **Fabric IQ / Unified Copilot** | Our MCP infrastructure powers the Copilot's tool invocations; our MCP Apps make Copilot interactions rich and visual |
| **AI-native platform** | Agents as first-class citizens; customer logic as MCP tools; autonomous agent workflows |
| **Developer growth** | Embedding Fabric in VS Code/ChatGPT/Claude → reach developers where they are → lower barrier to entry |
| **Enterprise trust** | Governance controls for agents; audit trails; SPN identity; admin policies |

---

## XV. KEY ASKS

### For This Retreat

1. **Endorse the thesis**: "Embedding Fabric Everywhere" as the unifying vision for the Fabric Embed and Automation team — expanding our charter from embedding items to embedding *all of Fabric's capabilities*

2. **Commit to foundational investment**: API completeness and future-proof throttling are non-negotiable prerequisites. Without them, no programmatic or agentic experience will work reliably.

3. **Greenlight the proof-of-concept**: Let us build the troubleshooting MCP App as a concrete demonstration of the three-layer model — grounded in the #1 CAT research pain point.

4. **Align on parallel streams**: Foundation, programmatic, and agentic work proceed simultaneously — compounding over time. This is a multi-year strategy, not a quarter.

5. **Clarify charter expansion**: If leadership endorses this direction, our team charter should formally expand from "Fabric Embed (items)" to "Embedding Fabric Everywhere (capabilities + experiences)."

---

## XVI. THE FUTURE WE'RE BUILDING

**By 2029:**

✅ **Fabric is embeddable** — any capability, any experience, anywhere  
✅ **Professional developers thrive** — troubleshoot, deploy, monitor from their IDE with NPS 50+  
✅ **Agents are first-class citizens** — autonomous operations, governed, auditable, at scale  
✅ **The portal is home base, not the only destination** — Fabric works in VS Code, ChatGPT, Teams, CI/CD, and surfaces we haven't imagined yet  
✅ **Customers extend Fabric** — their business logic is callable by any agent, turning Fabric into an operational platform  
✅ **The foundational layer is future-proof** — designed for millions of agents, not just thousands of humans  

---

> *"The best platforms don't ask users to come to them. They go to where the users are."*
>
> Let's build that.

## APPENDIX A: FROM FIVE DIRECTIONS TO ONE STORY

In prior strategy discussions, we identified 5 distinct directions for the team. This document doesn't replace them — it **unifies** them under a single strategic narrative. The "Embedding Fabric Everywhere" thesis provides the *why* behind all five, and the three-layer architecture shows how they connect. Here's the mapping:

| Previous Direction | New Location | Layer |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| **Dir 1: Scripting within Fabric** | Programmatic Layer → Scripting in Fabric workstream | Programmatic |
| **Dir 2: VS Code Experiences** | All three layers — sandbox/local dev (Foundational) + scripting/automation (Programmatic) + embedded experiences (Agentic) | All |
| **Dir 3: Functions as MCP Tools** | Agentic Layer → Customer MCP Tools workstream | Agentic |
| **Dir 4: Externalizing Agentic Capabilities** | Agentic Layer → Autonomous Agent Access workstream | Agentic |
| **Dir 5: AI-Powered Provisioning** | Agentic Layer → AI-Powered Provisioning workstream | Agentic |

The directions aren't removed — they're **contextualized** within a larger strategic narrative that explains *why* they matter and how they connect.
