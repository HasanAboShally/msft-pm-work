# Microsoft Fabric Developer Experience & Automation (DXA) Strategy (2026–2029)
## Alon Baram's Team: Enabling Professional Developers at Scale

**Team**: Alon Baram (Product Manager), Hasan Abo Shally (Senior PM), Evelina Alroy-Brin (PM)  
**GPM**: Aviv Ezrachi  
**Organization**: Kim Manis — Fabric Platform  
**Version**: 1.0 — January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

This 3-year strategy positions the **Developer Experience & Automation (DXA) team** as the **infrastructure and tooling foundation** that enables professional developers to automate, scale, and productionize their Fabric solutions. We own the **control plane tools** (APIs, CLI, Terraform, MCP, SDKs) that power everything from local development to enterprise CI/CD.

### The North Star

> "By 2029, every professional developer building on Fabric will have access to world-class automation infrastructure — enabling them to go from intent to production in minutes, not weeks, with the same rigor and velocity they expect from Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud."

### Strategic Positioning

**We are NOT**:
- The CI/CD orchestration team (Nimrod Shalit owns Deployment Pipelines, Git Integration, Variables)
- The in-product AI team (Unified Copilot team owns Blueprint, Creator Agent)
- The developer acquisition team (AppDev team owns VS Code extension adoption, freemium)

**We ARE**:
- The **control plane tools** team (APIs, CLI, Terraform, MCP, SDKs)
- The **automation infrastructure** team (enabling workflows, not building end-user UIs)
- The **developer enablement** team (providing primitives that others build on)

---

## Part 1: Strategic Context

### Kim Manis's Mandate

Kim's Krypton Memo explicitly prioritizes professional developer experience:

> "P1.6: Provide delightful developer experiences. **Developers who use Fabric > 8 days a month have an NPS of 12 (vs. 38 for less frequent users).**  
> Full CI/CD support across all workloads including git Integration, deployment pipelines, public format, relationship managements, **public APIs**, SPN support and variables."[11](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/msbicms/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B438EA7A5-5D49-4D09-B6B7-AAA7E8678CD7%7D&file=Platform%20Depedency%20Asks%20-%20Krypton.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

**Translation for Our Team**: Kim is saying "fix the fundamentals." APIs, SPN support, public format, relationship management — these are **our deliverables**, not CI/CD's.

### The Professional Developer Pain (CAT Research)

56 hours of interviews, 220 issues mapped to Jobs-to-Be-Done[6](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/personal/brucphillips_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BD9F961CA-57F0-49BA-8B70-28E2683BBE17%7D&file=Professional_developer_opportunity_analysis.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1):

**Top 4 Underserved Jobs**:
1. **CI/CD & Automated Deployment** (Top-ranked)
2. **Monitor and Troubleshoot** (Opportunity Score: 6.1 — Highly Underserved)
3. **Optimize Resource Spend & Capacity Planning**
4. **Manage and Monitor Access** (Service accounts, identity)

**Specific Pain Points** (verbatim from CAT Research):
- "Deployment is slow and manual, with limited automation. Git integration is not fully supported for deployments"
- "Monitoring is slow, unreliable, lacks filtering; alerts untrustworthy"
- "Without service accounts, processes run under individual user credentials"
- "Capacity contention: Multiple teams contend for the same capacity, one heavy workload can degrade others"

**What This Means for Us**: Our APIs, SPN support, and SDK quality **directly** impact whether pro-devs can solve these problems. CI/CD team builds the pipelines; we provide the **plumbing**.

## Part 2: Team Ownership & Boundaries

### What We Own (Core Charter)

| Asset | Status | Our Role |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Fabric Public APIs** (Core APIs) | GA | Own spec, authoring, quality, throttling, SPN support |
| **Fabric CLI** | GA (moving to open source Kr Q2) | Own CLI core, extensions framework, open-source strategy |
| **Fabric Terraform Provider** | Public Preview → GA | Own provider, resource coverage, HCL quality |
| **.NET SDK** | GA | Own SDK, code generation, developer experience |
| **Python SDK** | Public Preview → GA | Own SDK, code generation, developer experience |
| **Fabric MCP (Local)** | Public Preview → GA | Own local MCP for dev tools (VS Code, Claude, etc.) |
| **Fabric MCP (Hosted)** | Not started | **Shared with Unified Copilot** (see below) |

### What We Enable (Others Build On)

| Experience | Owner | Uses Our Assets |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| **Deployment Pipelines** (UI-driven deployment) | CI/CD Team (Nimrod) | ✅ Uses our APIs, CLI for backend operations |
| **Git Integration** (workspace-level source control) | CI/CD Team (Nimrod) | ✅ Uses our APIs for item CRUD, commit/sync |
| **Variables** (parameterized deployment) | CI/CD Team (Nimrod) | ✅ Uses our APIs for variable resolution |
| **Unified Copilot** (in-product AI) | Copilot Team (Emily/Rui/Ofri) | ✅ Uses our Fabric CRUD MCP for operations |
| **VS Code Extension** (developer acquisition) | AppDev Team (Sunitha) | ✅ Uses our CLI, MCP, APIs for functionality |
| **Power Platform** (citizen dev, low-code) | Power Platform Team | ✅ Uses our APIs for Fabric integration |

### Critical Boundary: MCP Ownership

**Unified Copilot Team is building**:
- **Fabric MCP Server Tools** (remote MCP Server, PuPr in Jan)
- **Creator Agent** (invokes Blueprint development, Fabric CRUD)

**Our Team is building**:
- **Local MCP** for dev tools (VS Code, Claude, GitHub Copilot)[8](https://loop.cloud.microsoft/p/eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9taWNyb3NvZnRldXItbXkuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vcGVyc29uYWwvYWxvbmJhX21pY3Jvc29mdF9jb20%2FbmF2PWN6MGxNa1p3WlhKemIyNWhiQ1V5Um1Gc2IyNWlZU1UxUm0xcFkzSnZjMjltZENVMVJtTnZiU1prUFdJbE1qRkhSV0pWVEVWM1JuaFZkVmxKTkVoNVJXcFdUalp5VUdGclVqRmFSbEZPUVhSb1ZUQm9aVUoyTVRWMWNqQXpTMjVPYldzelVqWjFjaVV5UkRoR1preEtOM2NtWmowd01VODNVVlkyU2xFeVZrSlROMGxFTmpSSVVrWmFWRlJOVGt0Sk5rVTBSRXBZSm1NOUpUSkcifQ%3D%3D)
- **MCP as infrastructure** (how other teams expose their capabilities via MCP)

**Agreement Needed**: We need explicit alignment with Unified Copilot team on:
1. **Local vs Hosted**: We own local MCP (for dev tools), they own hosted MCP (for in-product Copilot)
2. **Fabric CRUD MCP**: Who maintains this? (Proposal: we own the tool spec, they own Copilot integration)
3. **MCP Marketplace**: Who owns discoverability? (Proposal: shared responsibility)

- **Developer NPS: 40 → 50+** (industry-leading)
- **25% of provisioning tasks initiated by AI agents**

---

## Part 4: Strategic Initiatives (Cross-Cutting)

### Initiative 1: API-First Platform

**Goal**: Every Fabric capability is API-accessible on Day 1 (not "coming soon").

**Why It Matters**: Kim's memo explicitly calls this out: "We have too many instances where we release new capabilities with the APIs coming later. As Fabric gets adopted by more and more ISVs and enterprise developers this is causing frustration and confusion."[9](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/msbicms/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE6CFB95C-A73D-446D-9948-CEA7DECEBEE6%7D&file=Arun%20Ulag_FY25_Br_Priorities.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

**Our Role**:
- Define "API-first" policy with workload teams
- Provide API authoring co-pilot to accelerate workload API development[8](https://loop.cloud.microsoft/p/eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9taWNyb3NvZnRldXItbXkuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vcGVyc29uYWwvYWxvbmJhX21pY3Jvc29mdF9jb20%2FbmF2PWN6MGxNa1p3WlhKemIyNWhiQ1V5Um1Gc2IyNWlZU1UxUm0xcFkzSnZjMjltZENVMVJtTnZiU1prUFdJbE1qRkhSV0pWVEVWM1JuaFZkVmxKTkVoNVJXcFdUalp5VUdGclVqRmFSbEZPUVhSb1ZUQm9aVUoyTVRWMWNqQXpTMjVPYldzelVqWjFjaVV5UkRoR1preEtOM2NtWmowd01VODNVVlkyU2xFeVZrSlROMGxFTmpSSVVrWmFWRlJOVGt0Sk5rVTBSRXBZSm1NOUpUSkcifQ%3D%3D)
- Onboard Fabric Items to Core APIs (ongoing)

**Success Criteria**: 100% of GA items have GA APIs by end of 2027.

---

### Initiative 2: Developer NPS Instrumentation

**Goal**: Measure NPS for professional developers **by tool** (not just overall Fabric NPS).

**Why It Matters**: Current NPS measurement is platform-wide (42 overall, 12 for heavy users). We don't know if CLI users are happier than API-only users.

**Our Role**:
- Integrate FloodGate SDK into CLI (in-tool surveys)
- Add NPS prompts to VS Code extension (coordinate with AppDev team)
- Track "Developer MAU by Access Type" (API, CLI, SDK, Terraform)

**Success Criteria**: Segmented NPS tracking by Q4 2026, with separate scores for CLI, API, SDK, Terraform users.

---

### Initiative 3: Enable CI/CD Team's Success

**Goal**: Nimrod's CI/CD team can deliver on Kim's P1.6 mandate ("Full CI/CD support") by leveraging our infrastructure.

**Why It Matters**: CI/CD team's success depends on our API quality, SPN support, and relationship management. If we fail, they fail.

**Our Role**:
- Provide **Batch Export/Import API** (enables faster deployments)
- Provide **Relationship Management API** (auto-bind relations across environments)
- Provide **Variables API** (already in flight by CI/CD team, but uses our Core APIs)
- Coordinate on **ADO Pipelines Extension** (M)

**Coordination Points**:
- Weekly sync with Nimrod's team (already happening)
- Shared roadmap for "API gaps" (e.g., UPN support, Capacity-to-Workspace mapping)

---

### Initiative 4: MCP Ecosystem Leadership

**Goal**: Fabric becomes a leading contributor to the MCP standard and has the richest set of MCP tools for data platforms.

**Why It Matters**: External research shows MCP is becoming the "HTTP for AI agents" (Anthropic donated it to Linux Foundation). Early leadership positions Fabric as the most agent-friendly data platform.

**Our Role**:
- Own **Local MCP** for dev tools (GA March 2026)[7](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B6A3D5D81-7B9C-48D7-B58B-FDF64E4202F3%7D&file=Fabric%20automation%20and%20embedded%20review%20w%20Kim%20and%20Laurent%20-%20Dec%2010-25.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
- Coordinate with Unified Copilot team on **Hosted MCP** (they own in-product, we own infrastructure)
- Provide **MCP platform/infrastructure** for workloads to build their own MCPs

**Open Question**: Who owns the "MCP Marketplace" (discoverability of Fabric MCP tools)? Propose: shared responsibility with Unified Copilot.

---

## Part 5: Risks & Dependencies

### Risk 1: API Quality Crisis Continues

**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: **Critical**

**Threat**: If API throttling, reliability, or error messages don't improve, professional developers will continue to have NPS of 12, regardless of our CLI/SDK/Terraform investments.

**Mitigation**:
- API throttling increase (10 → 200 calls/min) is **P0** and already in flight
- API Throttling documentation (so devs know limits upfront)
- API authoring co-pilot to improve workload API quality[8](https://loop.cloud.microsoft/p/eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9taWNyb3NvZnRldXItbXkuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vcGVyc29uYWwvYWxvbmJhX21pY3Jvc29mdF9jb20%2FbmF2PWN6MGxNa1p3WlhKemIyNWhiQ1V5Um1Gc2IyNWlZU1UxUm0xcFkzSnZjMjltZENVMVJtTnZiU1prUFdJbE1qRkhSV0pWVEVWM1JuaFZkVmxKTkVoNVJXcFdUalp5VUdGclVqRmFSbEZPUVhSb1ZUQm9aVUoyTVRWMWNqQXpTMjVPYldzelVqWjFjaVV5UkRoR1preEtOM2NtWmowd01VODNVVlkyU2xFeVZrSlROMGxFTmpSSVVrWmFWRlJOVGt0Sk5rVTBSRXBZSm1NOUpUSkcifQ%3D%3D)

---

### Risk 2: Overlap/Conflict with CI/CD Team

**Likelihood**: High  
**Impact**: Medium

**Threat**: CAT Research shows "CI/CD & Automated Deployment" is the #1 underserved job. Both our team and Nimrod's team could claim this.

**Mitigation**:
- **Clear boundary**: We own **tools** (APIs, CLI, Terraform), they own **orchestration** (Deployment Pipelines, Git Integration, Variables)
- **Coordination**: Weekly syncs, shared roadmap for "API gaps"
- **Success is shared**: If CI/CD team succeeds, we succeed (because they use our tools)

---

### Risk 3: MCP Ownership Ambiguity

**Likelihood**: High  
**Impact**: Medium

**Threat**: Unified Copilot team is building "Fabric MCP Server Tools" (remote MCP Server, PuPr in Jan). Our team is building "Local MCP." Without clear boundaries, we'll duplicate work or conflict.

**Mitigation**:
- **Immediate**: Schedule alignment meeting with Emily/Rui/Ofri (Unified Copilot PMs)
- **Proposal**: We own Local MCP (for dev tools), they own Hosted MCP (for in-product Copilot)
- **Shared**: Fabric CRUD MCP tools (we own spec, they own Copilot integration)

---

### Risk 4: Developer Acquisition (AppDev Team) vs Activation (Us)

**Likelihood**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium

**Threat**: AppDev team (Sunitha) owns "VS Code extension adoption" and "developer acquisition." We own "professional developer activation." Unclear where acquisition ends and activation begins.

**Mitigation**:
- **Clear boundary**: AppDev owns **freemium, sign-ups, first-time user onboarding**. We own **professional tooling for production use** (APIs, CLI, Terraform, SDKs).
- **Coordination**: They drive developers to VS Code; we provide the CLI/MCP/APIs that make VS Code powerful.
- **Success is shared**: If they acquire developers, we activate them.

## Part 7: Integration with Aviv Ezrachi's Platform Strategy

### Aviv's Broader Platform Vision

As GPM for Platform, Aviv owns three teams:
1. **Automation (us)**: Control plane tools (APIs, CLI, Terraform, MCP, SDKs)
2. **CI/CD (Nimrod)**: Deployment orchestration (Pipelines, Git Integration, Variables)
3. **Extensibility (Teddy)**: ISV enablement (3P workloads, Fabric Marketplace)

### How We Fit into Aviv's Platform Strategy

**Aviv's Mission**: "Enable developers to build, deploy, and scale data solutions on Fabric with the same rigor and velocity they expect from Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud."

**Our Contribution**:
- **Automation**: We provide the **primitives** (APIs, CLI, SDKs) that enable automation
- **CI/CD**: Nimrod builds the **workflows** (Deployment Pipelines) that orchestrate our primitives
- **Extensibility**: Teddy enables **ISVs** who use our primitives to build 3P workloads

**Strategic Alignment**:
- Our **API-first** initiative enables Teddy's ISV customers
- Our **CLI/Terraform** tools enable Nimrod's CI/CD workflows
- Our **MCP** infrastructure enables both CI/CD automation and ISV extensibility

**Aviv's Role**:
- Resolve ownership conflicts (e.g., MCP, Cloud Shell, CLI Script Items)
- Ensure shared roadmap across Automation, CI/CD, Extensibility
- Represent Platform priorities to Kim/Arun's leadership

---

## Part 8: Positioning Narrative

### For Internal Stakeholders

**When presenting to Kim/Arun**:

> "We're the **infrastructure team** for professional developers. Just as Azure provides APIs, CLI, Terraform, and SDKs as **foundational primitives**, we provide the same for Fabric. CI/CD team builds workflows on top of us. Unified Copilot team uses our MCP tools. AppDev team leverages our CLI in VS Code. **If our APIs fail, everyone fails.**"

**When presenting to Aviv**:

> "We're the **connective tissue** between professional developers and Fabric. We don't own end-user experiences (that's CI/CD, Copilot, AppDev). We own the **control plane infrastructure** that makes those experiences possible. Our success is measured by how well we enable other teams."

**When presenting to Nimrod (CI/CD)**:

> "We're your **backend**. You own Deployment Pipelines (the UI), we own the APIs that make pipelines work. You own Git Integration (the workflow), we own the APIs that commit and sync items. **Your OKRs depend on our API quality.**"

**When presenting to Unified Copilot Team**:

> "We're your **tooling partner**. You own in-product Copilot experiences, we own the MCP infrastructure that makes Copilot powerful. You own Blueprint generation, we own the APIs that execute Blueprint specs. **We complement, not compete.**"

---

## Part 9: Next Steps (Immediate Actions)

### Week 1 (This Week)

1. **Align with Aviv**: Present this strategy, get endorsement, resolve open questions (MCP ownership, Cloud Shell, CLI Script Items)
2. **Sync with Nimrod**: Agree on "control plane tools" (us) vs "deployment orchestration" (them)
3. **Sync with Emily/Rui/Ofri**: Agree on "Local MCP" (us) vs "Hosted MCP" (them)

### Week 2-4 (January 2026)

4. **Finalize Kr Q2 Plan**: Translate this 3-year vision into semester deliverables (already in flight via Alon's pre-planning)[4](https://loop.cloud.microsoft/p/eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9taWNyb3NvZnRldXItbXkuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vcGVyc29uYWwvYWxvbmJhX21pY3Jvc29mdF9jb20%2FbmF2PWN6MGxNa1p3WlhKemIyNWhiQ1V5Um1Gc2IyNWlZU1UxUm0xcFkzSnZjMjltZENVMVJtTnZiU1prUFdJbE1qRkhSV0pWVEVWM1JuaFZkVmxKTkVoNVJXcFdUalp5VUdGclVqRmFSbEZPUVhSb1ZUQm9aVUoyTVRWMWNqQXpTMjVPYldzelVqWjFjaVV5UkRoR1preEtOM2NtWmowd01VODNVVlkyU2xkUk5GSTJVRWRFUlVSQ05VZExXRlJKVHpkWFR6ZEtOVmhRSm1NOUpUSkcifQ%3D%3D)
5. **Present to Kim's LT**: Get organizational buy-in (target: mid-Feb, during Kr Q2 planning reviews)
6. **CAT Research Engagement**: Schedule follow-up interviews with professional developers to validate our priorities

### Q1 2026

7. **API Quality Sprint**: Execute on throttling increase, SPN support, error message improvements
8. **CLI Open Source**: Launch open-source CLI, community contribution model
9. **Local MCP GA**: Ship at FabCon Atlanta (March 2026)[7](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B6A3D5D81-7B9C-48D7-B58B-FDF64E4202F3%7D&file=Fabric%20automation%20and%20embedded%20review%20w%20Kim%20and%20Laurent%20-%20Dec%2010-25.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

## Conclusion: Why This Strategy Will Succeed

**1. Grounded in Real Pain**: CAT Research shows professional developers are suffering **right now** from API quality, SPN gaps, and lack of automation tools. We're addressing their top pain points.

**2. Aligned with Kim's Priorities**: Kim's P1.6 ("Provide delightful developer experiences") explicitly calls out APIs, SPN support, and public format — our core deliverables.

**3. Clear Boundaries with Adjacent Teams**: We're not competing with CI/CD, Unified Copilot, or AppDev. We're providing the infrastructure they build on.

**4. Realistic Roadmap**: Year 1 fixes fundamentals (API quality), Year 2 scales tools (CLI open source, Terraform GA), Year 3 explores future capabilities (agents, Cloud Shell).

**5. Measurable Success**: Developer NPS (12 → 30 → 40 → 50) is our North Star, with leading indicators (MAU growth, API quality) tracking progress.

**6. Cross-Team Collaboration**: We succeed by enabling Nimrod's CI/CD workflows, Emily's Copilot experiences, and Sunitha's VS Code adoption. Our success is their success.

**Let's build the best automation infrastructure in the industry.**
