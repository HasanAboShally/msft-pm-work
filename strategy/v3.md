# Fabric Developer Experience & Automation (DXA) Strategy

## Who We Are

The Developer Experience & Automation (DXA) team — led by Alon Baram, with Hasan Abo Shally and Evelina Alroy-Brin — is responsible for building the control plane infrastructure that powers professional developer workflows in Microsoft Fabric.

We own the foundational tools that enable developers to automate, scale, and productionize their solutions with the same rigor and velocity they expect from Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud.

### Our Core Assets

## Our Strategy

### Our Mission

To empower professional developers with world-class automation infrastructure — and to meet them where they are. We do this by:

1. Bringing professional developers into Fabric through native, secure, and scalable automation experiences.
2. Bringing Fabric to professional developers by integrating with the tools they already use — especially VS Code, GitHub, and Terraform.

---

### Our Dual Strategic Directions

#### 1. Bring Pro-Devs Into Fabric

We make Fabric a first-class platform for professional developers by:

- Providing a complete CLI and Terraform experience for provisioning, managing, and deploying Fabric resources.
- Ensuring every Fabric workload is API-first and SPN-ready, enabling automation at scale.
- Delivering a Hosted MCP that allows AI agents and Copilots to orchestrate Fabric operations in a secure, governed way.
- Supporting CI/CD workflows through backend APIs and SDKs that power Git integration, deployment pipelines, and variables.
- 🆕 Introducing sandboxed environments for experimentation and onboarding:
  - Developers can spin up isolated, time-bound Fabric environments to test deployments, pipelines, and automation scripts without impacting production.
  - Sandboxes are provisioned via CLI or Terraform and automatically expire unless promoted.
  - Ideal for onboarding new developers, testing new features, or validating automation flows.

🧩 Example: A platform engineer at a large enterprise wants to automate the provisioning of 100 Fabric workspaces with preconfigured pipelines and access policies. Using our Terraform provider and CLI, they can do this in minutes — without touching the UI.

📊 Impact: This direction directly addresses the top 4 underserved jobs from CAT research, including CI/CD, monitoring, access management, and capacity planning.

#### 2. Bring Fabric to Pro-Devs Where They Are

We meet developers in their native environments by:

- Integrating Fabric CLI and MCP into VS Code, GitHub Copilot, and Claude.
- Enabling local iteration and validation through Local MCP and CLI Script Items.
- Supporting developer-first workflows like “git push → deploy” using familiar tools and patterns.
- 🆕 Providing sandboxed CLI sessions in VS Code:
  - Developers can run Fabric CLI commands in a local sandbox with simulated responses or limited-scope access.
  - Enables safe experimentation, learning, and prototyping without requiring full tenant permissions.

🧩 Example: A data engineer working in VS Code wants to test a Fabric pipeline locally before pushing it to production. With Local MCP and CLI integration, they can validate the pipeline, commit to Git, and trigger a deployment — all from their IDE.

📊 Impact: This direction aligns with Kim Manis’s vision of a “productive, familiar IDE-like environment with a great multitasking experience” and supports the hybrid strategy outlined in the Fabric ProDev Strategy Deck.

🧠 | AI Agent  
— Copilots, Claude, GitHub Copilot, internal agents  
— Need structured, reliable automation interfaces  
— Use MCP to orchestrate Fabric operations  
— Expect: Predictable, secure, scalable APIs

🏢 | Center of Excellence (CoE) Leader  
— Responsible for governance, enablement, and scale  
— Need reusable templates, provisioning frameworks  
— Want: Standardization, best practices, automation at scale

🧪 | New Developer / Experimenter  
— Exploring Fabric for the first time  
— Needs safe, low-friction way to try things  
— Wants: Sandboxes, tutorials, CLI playgrounds  
— Pain: Fear of breaking things, unclear onboarding path

### Our Positioning

🧭 When presenting to Kim Manis:  
“We are fixing the fundamentals — APIs, SPN support, CLI, Terraform — to raise developer NPS from 12 to 40+. We’re the team that makes Fabric usable for real-world production.”

🧭 When presenting to Nimrod Shalit (CI/CD):  
“You own the orchestration (pipelines, Git), we own the plumbing (APIs, CLI, Terraform). We’re your backend — and we’re investing to make your workflows reliable and scalable.”

🧭 When presenting to Unified Copilot Team:  
“You own the in-product experience. We own the Hosted MCP and the tools that make Copilot powerful. Let’s align on the Fabric CRUD MCP and the roadmap for agent orchestration.”

🧭 When presenting to Teddy Bercovitz (Center of Excellence):  
“Your CoE can scale developer success by building on our provisioning APIs and Terraform modules. We’ll provide the automation primitives — you build the templates, best practices, and governance. And with sandboxing, you can offer safe experimentation environments for onboarding and training.”

## Strategic Narrative

🧭 When presenting to Kim Manis:  
“This is a coordinated platform strategy. DXA builds the tools, CI/CD builds the workflows, and the CoE scales adoption. Together, we’re fixing the fundamentals and enabling Fabric to win with professional developers.”

🧭 When presenting to Arun Ulag or Fabric LT:  
“We are not three teams — we are one platform. Our shared mission is to make Fabric the best place for developers to build, deploy, and scale. We’re fixing the gaps, aligning ownership, and enabling the next wave of growth.”

🧭 When presenting to new developers or ISVs:  
“Fabric is no longer a black box. You can try it, script it, automate it, and scale it — all from your terminal or IDE. And if you’re just getting started, we’ve got sandboxes, templates, and tools to help you succeed.”
