# Fabric Platform Automation Team — Potential Efforts and Strategic Directions

As Microsoft Fabric evolves into a unified, AI-native data platform, we are entering a pivotal moment in how data experiences are built, automated, and extended. The rise of generative AI and agentic workflows is reshaping expectations across the industry—developers, analysts, and business users alike now expect systems that are not only programmable, but also intelligent, proactive, and deeply integrated into their tools of choice.

At Microsoft, this shift is reflected in the emergence of Fabric IQ and the Unified Copilot, which signal a broader transformation: from static data tools to dynamic, AI-powered agents capable of reasoning, orchestrating, and acting across the platform. These changes are not just about user experience—they redefine the boundaries of what can be automated, who can automate, and how automation is governed.

In this context, our Fabric Automation team is charting a forward-looking strategy to unlock new layers of productivity, extensibility, and intelligence. The following five directions represent focused, modular investments that align with this vision. Each direction is designed to stand on its own, yet together they form a cohesive foundation for the next generation of automation in Fabric.


## Our vision
“Automation for humans and agents—intelligent, intuitive, and everywhere in Fabric.”
Empower every Fabric user and developer—human and AI alike—to automate with intelligence, build with confidence, and operate at scale, by transforming Microsoft Fabric into an AI-native, programmable platform where automation is intuitive, agentic, and deeply integrated across the ecosystem.



**1. Scripting within Fabric (Automating Click-Ops in the Portal):** *Empower users to automate repetitive tasks directly in the Fabric UI.* This direction introduces a **“Script” item type in the Fabric web portal**, enabling admins and citizen developers to record or write mini-scripts for routine operations instead of clicking through the UI. For example, an admin could create a weekly cleanup script that scans workspaces and emails owners of inactive ones – all from within Fabric, no external tools needed. Fabric Copilot would assist in a “**Script Mode**,” where the user describes the task and Copilot generates a CLI script or sequence of steps that the user can tweak and save as an item. These script items are **shareable, auditable, and schedulable** (with support for using service principals for execution), so teams can reuse automations and run them safely under delegated permissions. In the long run, this unlocks the “**long tail**” of Fabric automation – tasks too niche or infrequent to justify full features – by letting AI help users automate them on the fly. (Future vision: Fabric might even detect common manual patterns and suggest ready-made scripts to the user.) 

**2. VS Code Experiences (Pro-Dev Sandboxing and Authoring):** *Make Fabric a first-class experience in VS Code for professional developers.* This direction focuses on delivering a **rich local development and sandbox environment** for Fabric via the VS Code extension. The idea is to let developers **create, test, and deploy Fabric artifacts entirely from VS Code**, with features like an integrated Fabric CLI, local simulation of jobs, and one-click deployment to the cloud. For example, a data engineer could spin up a *“Fabric Sandbox”* – a dedicated development workspace – where a subset of production data is automatically copied or anonymized for safe testing. They could then use VS Code to write a pipeline or notebook against that sandbox, run it locally or in an isolated cloud context, debug it, and only then promote it to a live workspace. By **sandboxing with real data** (or AI-generated dummy data), developers can iterate faster with less risk. This direction also involves enhancing source control integration (e.g. Git integration for workspaces) and possibly supporting “blueprint to code” workflows – for instance, exporting a Fabric Blueprint (a template of a workspace) as code, editing it in VS Code, and deploying it via CLI. Overall, the goal is to meet developers in their tools of choice (VS Code) and provide a familiar DevOps-like experience for Fabric (local edit/debug, CI/CD, etc.), which in turn encourages best practices and accelerates solution development. 

**3. Functions as MCP Tools (Customer Logic as Callable Operations):** *Allow users to expose their own code and processes to AI agents as first-class operations.* In this direction, a Fabric user could take custom logic – such as a notebook, a Data Pipeline, or a stored procedure (e.g. a user-defined function in a warehouse) – and **publish it as an MCP tool** with a name and description. This effectively lets customers create their own “Fabric Copilot skills.” For example, if a company has a proprietary process to calculate a finance metric, they can wrap it as a tool called “ComputeFinanceMetric” that an agent (or Copilot) can invoke in one step. Under the hood, this might involve grouping one or more Fabric items and defining an interface (parameters/results) for them. The key value is that these user-defined tools become **discoverable and usable by AI agents** just like built-in Fabric operations. Today, a user could manually run a notebook or pipeline via API, but the agent wouldn’t know about it; by registering it as an MCP tool, with proper metadata, the Copilot can plan to use it when relevant. This positions Fabric not just as an analytics platform but as an **operational platform**: organizations can codify business-specific operations and expose them to automation. In the near term, this might mean introducing an **“MCP Server Item”** in Fabric – essentially a container of custom tools hosted by Fabric. Longer-term, it dovetails with making Fabric extensible: imagine a marketplace or library where common custom tools (or templates) can be shared across workspaces or even between customers. (The API exposure of these tools would be a bonus – e.g. calling the custom operation via a REST endpoint – but the primary focus is enabling AI orchestration via MCP.) 

**4. Externalizing Fabric’s Agentic Capabilities:** *Open up Fabric’s automation capabilities to external AI agents and services.* Fabric’s internal Copilot (the “unified Copilot”) uses a set of MCP tools to perform actions like creating workspaces, uploading data, or refreshing datasets. This direction proposes exposing those same capabilities to **external agents** – for instance, an agent running in VS Code, in Azure AI Studio, or even a third-party AI orchestration service. Concretely, we would provide a **unified endpoint (MCP server)** that an authenticated external client can connect to, which offers the full catalog of Fabric operations as tools. This would allow scenarios such as a GitHub Copilot extension that can spin up Fabric resources as you write code, or an autonomous AI workflow (outside Fabric) that nonetheless can call Fabric to, say, publish a report. To do this safely, we’d treat external agents as **first-class personas** in Fabric, with proper identity (likely implemented via service principals or delegated user tokens) and governance controls. Every action they take would go through the same permission checks and audit logs as a user in the portal. In essence, Fabric becomes “headless”: anything you can do in the Fabric UI or Copilot, you could do via an external API/agent. This not only empowers pro developers (e.g. enabling custom devops pipelines or integration of Fabric into larger systems), but also sets the stage for cross-product agents. For example, a Microsoft 365 Copilot in the future could coordinate Fabric tasks (via this interface) as part of a broader business process. A crucial aspect of this direction is security and management – we’d likely introduce admin controls to approve or restrict external agent access, define scopes of operations, or impose read-only modes to address governance concerns. When combined with Direction 3, customers could even expose their custom MCP tools through this external interface, meaning an external AI agent could perform company-specific operations in Fabric securely.

**5. AI-Powered Provisioning and Blueprint Automation:** *Make provisioning of Fabric assets declarative, repeatable, and AI-assisted.* This direction targets the **setup and configuration phase**: creating workspaces, assigning capacities, setting up security, deploying standard artifacts, etc. The vision is to let users specify their intent at a high level – for example, “Create a new workspace for the finance team with our standard policies, a Lakehouse, and a pipeline” – and have the system (with AI help) take care of the detailed provisioning steps. We already have **Fabric Blueprints**, which are templates for deploying multiple items (often used for solution starters). We want to expand on this blueprint concept in two ways: **(a)** enable a Blueprint to capture not just items, but also configurations like workspace settings, role assignments, security policies, and governance rules; and **(b)** allow Blueprints to be expressed as code (Infrastructure-as-Code) that AI can generate or modify. In practice, this might mean a user can author a blueprint JSON/YAML (or Terraform script) that defines their Fabric workspace setup, check it into source control, and use an AI-assisted CLI tool to deploy it. Even more compelling, an AI agent in VS Code or Copilot chat could **translate a natural language request into a Blueprint**. For instance, a user says the sentence from above (“finance team workspace with standard policies”), and the AI generates the code for a blueprint that includes all the required resources and settings, citing company policy libraries for things like naming conventions or access controls. This blueprint could then be reviewed, adjusted, and applied, resulting in a fully configured workspace in one go. The value here is twofold: **consistency** (every new project can adhere to IT’s best practices by using approved templates, avoiding the drift and manual setup errors) and **efficiency** (cut down a 20-step manual provisioning process to a single command or conversation). This direction complements the others by providing the *starting point* for Fabric environments: whereas scripting (Dir. 1) and custom tools (Dir. 3) help automate within an existing workspace, AI-powered provisioning sets up the workspaces and baselines in the first place. It also leverages the externalization (Dir. 4) — the provisioning agent could live outside Fabric, calling into Fabric’s MCP to create stuff — and the VS Code integration (Dir. 2) — developers could manage environment configs alongside their code. In summary, this direction moves Fabric toward an **“declare what you need, not how to build it”** model, with AI ensuring that what gets built is aligned with best practices and the user’s intent.
