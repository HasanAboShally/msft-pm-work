## PART I: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & STRATEGIC CONTEXT

### 1.1 Strategic Mandate from Leadership

Kim Manis's Krypton Memo establishes clear organizational priorities:

> "P1.6: Provide delightful developer experiences. Developers who use Fabric > 8 days a month have an NPS of 12 (vs. 38 for less frequent users). Full CI/CD support across all workloads including git Integration, deployment pipelines, public format, relationship managements, public APIs, SPN support and variables."[9](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/msbicms/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B438EA7A5-5D49-4D09-B6B7-AAA7E8678CD7%7D&file=Platform%20Depedency%20Asks%20-%20Krypton.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)

**The Problem**: Professional developers — the builders who automate, scale, and productionize — are Fabric's most dissatisfied user segment, yet they represent 90% of Fabric customers using automation tools[18](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BA6BD1FB0-A87E-4F90-B742-ABCB681D0AA5%7D&file=Kr%20Q2%20cut%20lines.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).

**The Opportunity**: The rise of generative AI and agentic workflows is reshaping expectations — developers, analysts, and business users alike now expect systems that are not only programmable, but also **intelligent, proactive, and deeply integrated** into their tools of choice.

**Our Charter**: The Developer Experience & Automation (DXA) team is the control plane infrastructure team that enables professional developers, citizen developers, and AI agents to build, deploy, and manage at scale with the same rigor and velocity they expect from Azure or AWS.

### 1.2 Research Foundation

This strategy is grounded in the most comprehensive developer research in Fabric history:

**CAT Professional Developer Program (Nov 2025)**[23]():
- **56 hours of 1:1 interviews** with professional developers
- **220 unique issues** extracted and mapped to Jobs-to-Be-Done
- **110 pro-devs surveyed** for opportunity analysis
- **13 underserved jobs identified**, including CI/CD, monitoring, capacity planning, and automation

**Key Finding**: Professional developers are "the most dissatisfied segment" but represent our highest growth potential—they already make up **110K API MAU, growing at 19% MoM**[18](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BA6BD1FB0-A87E-4F90-B742-ABCB681D0AA5%7D&file=Kr%20Q2%20cut%20lines.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).

### 1.3 Current State: Strong Usage, Low Satisfaction

**Usage Metrics (Dec 2025)**[18](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BA6BD1FB0-A87E-4F90-B742-ABCB681D0AA5%7D&file=Kr%20Q2%20cut%20lines.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1):
- **Public APIs**: 110.2K MAU (+13% MoM), 2.9M monthly API calls, 37.1K MAT (+9% MoM)
- **Fabric CLI**: 1,412 MAU (+17% MoM), 168K total downloads, 1,012 MAT
- **Terraform Provider**: 489 MAU (+6% MoM), 356K total downloads, 883 MAT
- **Top API Customers**: KPMG, Deutsche, GIZ, NOVAIMS, BAT, ALLSTATE Insurance, EY, Wells Fargo, Eli Lilly, Prudential, Capgemini, Equinor

**Critical Insight**: "Fabric public APIs MAU grows in double digit rate and MAT grows even faster – it is now close to 90% of fabric active customers"[18](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BA6BD1FB0-A87E-4F90-B742-ABCB681D0AA5%7D&file=Kr%20Q2%20cut%20lines.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).

**The Satisfaction Gap**: Despite strong usage growth, developer NPS for heavy users (>8 days/month) is **only 12** compared to 42 overall[9](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/msbicms/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B438EA7A5-5D49-4D09-B6B7-AAA7E8678CD7%7D&file=Platform%20Depedency%20Asks%20-%20Krypton.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1).

## PART II: STRATEGIC VISION & MISSION

### 2.1 Our North Star (2026-2029)

> **"Automation for humans and agents — intelligent, intuitive, and everywhere in Fabric."**
>
> Empower every Fabric user and developer — human and AI alike — to automate with intelligence, build with confidence, and operate at scale, by transforming Microsoft Fabric into an **AI-native, programmable platform** where automation is intuitive, agentic, and deeply integrated across the ecosystem.

### 2.2 Why This Vision Matters Now

The emergence of **Fabric IQ and the Unified Copilot** signals a broader transformation: from static data tools to dynamic, AI-powered agents capable of reasoning, orchestrating, and acting across the platform. These changes are not just about user experience — they **redefine the boundaries of what can be automated, who can automate, and how automation is governed**.

In this context, our DXA team is charting a forward-looking strategy to unlock new layers of productivity, extensibility, and intelligence.

### 2.3 Our Unique Value Proposition

**We Are**: The control plane infrastructure team for Microsoft Fabric

**We Own**:
- Fabric Public APIs (Core APIs)
- Fabric CLI and extensions framework
- Terraform Provider
- .NET and Python SDKs
- **Fabric MCP (Hosted & Local)** — full ownership【meeting context】
- Developer tooling and automation infrastructure

**We Are NOT**:
- The CI/CD orchestration team (Nimrod Shalit owns Deployment Pipelines, Git Integration, Variables)
- The in-product AI team (Unified Copilot team owns Blueprint, Creator Agent)
- The developer acquisition team (AppDev team owns VS Code extension adoption, freemium)
- The extensibility/ISV team (Teddy Bercovitz owns 3P workload enablement)

**Our Strategic Positioning**: We provide the **foundational tools and infrastructure** that enable other teams to deliver end-user experiences — and now, we enable **AI agents** as first-class consumers of those tools.

---

## PART III: THE FIVE STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS

Our strategy is built around **five modular, forward-looking directions** that align with the AI-native transformation of Fabric. Each direction is designed to stand on its own, yet together they form a cohesive foundation for the next generation of automation in Fabric.

### Direction 1: Scripting within Fabric (Automating Click-Ops in the Portal)

> *Empower users to automate repetitive tasks directly in the Fabric UI.*

**The Problem**: 
- Admins and citizen developers spend hours clicking through the UI for routine operations
- Tasks too niche or infrequent to justify full features remain manual
- No way to record, share, or schedule common multi-step operations

**The Solution**:
This direction introduces a **"Script" item type in the Fabric web portal**, enabling admins and citizen developers to record or write mini-scripts for routine operations instead of clicking through the UI.

**Key Features**:
- **Script Item Type**: A new Fabric item for storing CLI scripts
- **Script Mode in Copilot**: Users describe the task, Copilot generates a CLI script or sequence of steps
- **Shareable, Auditable, Schedulable**: Scripts are version-controlled, auditable, and can run on schedules
- **Service Principal Execution**: Scripts can execute under delegated permissions (SPNs)

**Example Use Case**:
An admin creates a weekly cleanup script that scans workspaces and emails owners of inactive ones — all from within Fabric, no external tools needed.

**Long-Term Vision**:
Fabric might detect common manual patterns and **suggest ready-made scripts** to users, unlocking the "long tail" of automation.

**Success Metrics**:
- Script Item adoption: 5K MAU by Year 2
- Copilot Script Mode usage: 20% of Copilot interactions involve script generation
- Time saved: 50% reduction in manual click-ops for common tasks

---

### Direction 2: VS Code Experiences (Pro-Dev Sandboxing and Authoring)

> *Make Fabric a first-class experience in VS Code for professional developers.*

**The Problem**:
- Developers can't test Fabric artifacts locally before deployment
- No integrated sandbox environment for safe iteration
- Context switching between IDE and portal costs ~23 minutes per interruption

**The Solution**:
Deliver a **rich local development and sandbox environment** for Fabric via the VS Code extension. Developers can create, test, and deploy Fabric artifacts entirely from VS Code.

**Key Features**:
- **Fabric Sandbox**: Spin up a dedicated development workspace where a subset of production data is automatically copied or anonymized for safe testing
- **Local MCP Integration**: Run and validate pipelines locally with schema compliance
- **Blueprint-to-Code**: Export a Fabric Blueprint as code (Terraform/CLI), edit in VS Code, deploy via CLI
- **One-Click Deployment**: Write code, validate, deploy to cloud workspace
- **Enhanced Git Integration**: Folder structure maintained, proper sync workflows

**Example Use Case**:
A data engineer spins up a "Fabric Sandbox" with anonymized production data, writes a pipeline in VS Code, debugs locally using Local MCP, and promotes to live workspace only when ready.

**Success Metrics**:
- VS Code Extension MAU: 10K → 25K
- Local MCP usage: 15K MAU by Year 2
- Average iteration cycles before deployment: 3x increase (faster feedback loops)

---

### Direction 3: Functions as MCP Tools (Customer Logic as Callable Operations)

> *Allow users to expose their own code and processes to AI agents as first-class operations.*

**The Problem**:
- Customers have proprietary business logic (notebooks, pipelines, stored procedures) that agents can't discover or invoke
- No way to register custom operations for Copilot or external agents to use
- AI orchestration is limited to built-in Fabric operations

**The Solution**:
Enable users to take custom logic — such as a notebook, a Data Pipeline, or a stored procedure — and **publish it as an MCP tool** with a name and description.

**Key Features**:
- **Custom MCP Tools**: Wrap any Fabric item (notebook, pipeline, stored procedure) as an MCP-callable tool
- **MCP Server Item**: A new item type in Fabric — a container of custom tools hosted by Fabric
- **Discoverable by Agents**: User-defined tools appear in MCP catalogs, usable by Copilot and external agents
- **API Exposure**: Custom tools can also be called via REST endpoints

**Example Use Case**:
A finance company has a proprietary "ComputeFinanceMetric" process. They wrap it as an MCP tool. Now, when a user asks Copilot "What's the Q4 finance metric?", Copilot invokes the custom tool in one step.

**Long-Term Vision**:
A **marketplace or library** where common custom tools (or templates) can be shared across workspaces or even between customers.

**Success Metrics**:
- MCP Server Items created: 2K by Year 2
- Custom MCP tool invocations: 50K/month by Year 2
- Customer adoption of custom tools: 15% of enterprise customers

---

### Direction 4: Externalizing Fabric's Agentic Capabilities

> *Open up Fabric's automation capabilities to external AI agents and services.*

**The Problem**:
- Fabric's internal Copilot uses MCP tools, but external agents (GitHub Copilot, Claude, custom AI services) can't access Fabric operations
- No standard way for external automation to orchestrate Fabric
- Governance and security concerns around external access

**The Solution**:
Expose Fabric's MCP capabilities to **external agents** via a unified endpoint (Hosted MCP Server) that offers the full catalog of Fabric operations as tools.

**Key Features**:
- **Hosted MCP Server**: Authenticated endpoint exposing all Fabric operations as MCP tools
- **External Agent Support**: GitHub Copilot, VS Code Copilot, Claude, Azure AI Studio, and custom agents can connect
- **Agent Identity**: External agents are first-class personas with proper identity (SPNs, delegated tokens)
- **Governance Controls**: Admin controls to approve/restrict external agent access, define scopes, enforce read-only modes
- **Audit Trails**: Every agent action goes through the same permission checks and audit logs as a user

**Example Use Cases**:
- A GitHub Copilot extension spins up Fabric resources as you write code
- An autonomous AI workflow (outside Fabric) publishes reports to Fabric
- A Microsoft 365 Copilot coordinates Fabric tasks as part of a broader business process

**Combined with Direction 3**:
Customers can expose their **custom MCP tools** through this external interface — meaning an external AI agent can perform company-specific operations in Fabric securely.

**Success Metrics**:
- External MCP connections: 5K by Year 2
- External agent invocations: 100K/month by Year 2
- % of provisioning tasks initiated by external agents: 15%

---

### Direction 5: AI-Powered Provisioning and Blueprint Automation

> *Make provisioning of Fabric assets declarative, repeatable, and AI-assisted.*

**The Problem**:
- Provisioning is a 20-step manual process (create workspace, assign capacity, set security, deploy artifacts)
- No way to capture and repeat complex setups
- Configuration drift between environments (dev/test/prod)

**The Solution**:
Let users specify their intent at a high level — and have the system (with AI help) take care of the detailed provisioning steps.

**Key Features**:
- **Enhanced Blueprints**: Blueprints capture not just items, but also workspace settings, role assignments, security policies, and governance rules
- **Blueprints as Code (IaC)**: Express Blueprints as JSON/YAML or Terraform, check into source control, deploy via CLI
- **AI-Generated Blueprints**: User says "Create a finance team workspace with our standard policies, a Lakehouse, and a pipeline" → AI generates the Blueprint code
- **Policy Libraries**: Reference company-defined naming conventions, access controls, governance rules in Blueprints
- **One-Command Deployment**: Apply Blueprint → fully configured workspace

**Example Use Case**:
An IT admin says: "Create a workspace for the finance team with standard policies." The AI generates a Blueprint that includes naming conventions, access policies, Lakehouse, pipeline — all in version-controlled code. Admin reviews, tweaks, and applies with one command.

**Strategic Value**:
- **Consistency**: Every new project adheres to IT's best practices
- **Efficiency**: 20-step process → 1 command
- **Governance**: Blueprints are auditable, repeatable, version-controlled

**Success Metrics**:
- Blueprint-to-code conversions: 10K by Year 2
- AI-generated Blueprints: 5K by Year 2
- Time to provision new workspace: 20 steps → <5 minutes

| "Multiple teams contend for capacity" | AI-Powered Provisioning | Policy-enforced capacity allocation in Blueprints |
| "Processes run under individual credentials" | Externalizing Agentic | Agent identity with SPNs |
| "Long tail stays manual" | Scripting in Fabric | Copilot Script Mode, shareable scripts |
| "No local validation, context switching" | VS Code Experiences | Local MCP, Fabric Sandbox |

### 5.3 API Quality Crisis (Most Critical)

**API Throttling** is the **#1 blocker**[13](https://microsofteur-my.sharepoint.com/personal/alonba_microsoft_com/Documents/Microsoft%20Teams%20Chat%20Files/Fabric%20automation%20and%20embedded%20review%20w%20Kim%20and%20Laurent%20-%20Dec%2010-25.pptx):
- **Current limit**: 10 API calls/min/user (severely inadequate)
- **Planned improvement**: Raise to **200 API calls/min/user** for CRUD operations—this is **P0**

**This is foundational**: All 5 directions depend on reliable, high-throughput APIs.

---

## PART VI: DUAL STRATEGIC APPROACHES

### 6.1 The Strategic Framework: Hybrid Convergence

Alon Baram's guidance (Dec 24, 2025):
> "You are not bound to any paradigm, though **a combination of tools is more likely to be accepted** (e.g. CLI, MCP and a CI/CD tool like Terraform or Git, etc.)"

**Our Approach**: Not "either/or" but "both, with smart phasing."

---

### Pillar 6: Sandboxing & Experimentation (Direction 2)

**Goal**: Enable safe, low-friction experimentation for developers at all skill levels.

**Fabric Sandbox** (Ephemeral Workspace):
- **What It Is**: Temporary, isolated environment for scaffolding and iteration
- **How It Works**: Auto-provision, seed with AI-generated dummy data, auto-cleanup
- **Use Cases**:
  - Onboarding new developers (safe to break things)
  - Testing pipelines before production
  - Hackathons and experimentation

**AI-Generated Dummy Data**:
- Seed sandbox workspaces with realistic test data based on schema
- Accelerates iteration, reduces manual setup

**CLI Sandbox Mode**:
- Simulated responses or limited-scope access

**Success Metrics**:
- Sandbox workspace usage: 10K MAU by Year 2
- AI-generated dummy data seeds: 5K/month
- Onboarding time reduction: 50%

---

### Pillar 7: Developer NPS Instrumentation

**Goal**: Measure and improve NPS **by tool** (not just overall Fabric NPS).

**The Problem**: 
- APIs have no UI → "super hard to measure NPS for APIs"
- We don't know if CLI users are happier than API-only users

**The Solution**: In-tool NPS surveys

**Via VS Code Extension**:
- Embedded surveys in extension
- Track VS Code-specific NPS

**Via Cloud Shell / Codespace**:
- In-product CLI provides native UI for NPS surveys
- CLI-specific NPS separate from general API NPS

**Proposed Metrics Framework**:

| Metric | Current | Target (2029) |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Overall Developer NPS | 42 | >50 |
| VS Code Extension NPS | Not tracked | >45 |
| CLI NPS | Not tracked | >40 |
| API NPS | Not tracked | >40 |
| Developer MAU (Automation) | 110K APIs, 1.4K CLI | 300K APIs, 30K CLI |

## PART XII: CONCLUSION & CALL TO ACTION

### 12.1 Why This Strategy Will Succeed

**1. Grounded in Real Pain**: CAT Research shows professional developers are suffering **right now** from API quality, lack of SPN support, poor CI/CD, and manual provisioning.

**2. Forward-Looking for AI Era**: The 5 directions position Fabric for the agentic future — where AI agents are first-class citizens that automate alongside humans.

**3. Modular and Phased**: Each direction stands alone, reducing risk. We prioritize foundations (Dir 1-2) before advanced capabilities (Dir 3-5).

**4. Aligned with Leadership**: Kim's P1.6 priority directly calls for what we're building.

**5. Measurable Success**: Clear metrics at each phase.

### 12.2 The 5 Directions Summary

| Direction | One-Line Summary | Year |
|-----------|------------------|------|
| **1. Scripting within Fabric** | Automate click-ops with shareable, schedulable scripts | 2026 |
| **2. VS Code Experiences** | Local development, sandboxing, Blueprint-to-code | 2026 |
| **3. Functions as MCP Tools** | Customer logic as agent-callable operations | 2027 |
| **4. Externalizing Agentic Capabilities** | External agents connect via Hosted MCP | 2027 |
| **5. AI-Powered Provisioning** | Declarative, AI-assisted workspace setup | 2026-2027 |

### 12.3 The Future We're Building

**By 2029**:

- ✅ **Professional developers feel at home in Fabric** (Codespace, VS Code, CLI, Terraform)
- ✅ **Citizen developers automate with confidence** (Cloud Shell, Script Mode, Copilot)
- ✅ **AI agents are first-class citizens** (Hosted MCP, custom MCP tools, agent identity)
- ✅ **Provisioning is declarative and AI-assisted** (Blueprints as code, AI-generated specs)
- ✅ **Custom business logic is agent-callable** (MCP Server Items, tool marketplace)
- ✅ **Fabric is the #1 developer-friendly, AI-native data platform** (NPS 50+)
