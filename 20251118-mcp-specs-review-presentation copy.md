## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Microsoft Fabric MCP Strategy**  
**Enabling Fabric's AI-Native Future**

*The open standard that makes AI agents work seamlessly with Fabric*

---

## Slide 2: Fabric's AI Transformation

**From Data Platform to Intelligence Platform**

**The Industry Shift Toward AI Agents:**
- **Traditional:** Humans query data, analyze results, make decisions
- **AI-Native:** AI agents orchestrate data workflows, automate insights, drive actions

**Industry Reality:**
- **Gartner 2024:** 62% of enterprises cite "integration complexity" as top barrier to AI agent adoption
- **Protiviti 2025:** 68% of organizations expect to have integrated AI agents by 2026
- **15,000+ MCP servers** already deployed globally (open ecosystem rapidly expanding)

**The Opportunity:** AI agents need standardized, enterprise-grade infrastructure to work with analytics platforms.

**Fabric's Strategic Response:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) - the open standard for AI agent integration.

**Note:** Just last week (Nov 18, 2025), we announced **[Fabric IQ](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/from-data-platform-to-intelligence-platform-introducing-microsoft-fabric-iq)** - marking Fabric's evolution to an **intelligence platform**.

---


**How Developers Work With AI Agents:**
- **Interactive (Conversational):** Chat with Copilot to generate code, ask questions, get guidance
- **Code Generation:** AI writes Fabric API integration code, schemas, deployment scripts
- **Autonomous (Programmatic):** Agents run on schedule or triggered by events - no human in the loop

---

## Slide 3: A Concrete Example - The Pro Developer Challenge

**Imagine you're Ren, a Data Engineer at an enterprise:**

**Your Challenge:**  
Deploy Fabric workspace environments across 50+ customer tenants. Each deployment needs:
- 3 workspaces (Dev, Staging, Production)
- Lakehouses and Warehouses provisioned
- Permissions configured (customer admins, your team as contributors)
- CI/CD pipelines set up for continuous deployment

**Today's Reality (Manual Portal Workflow):**
- ⏱️ **Time:** 2-3 days per customer environment
- ❌ **Errors:** 3-4 failed deployments before success (permission mistakes, schema errors)
- 😞 **Pain:** Context switching (Portal → VS Code → Docs → Portal), repetitive clicking
- 📉 **Scale:** Can handle ~5 new customers per quarter (bottleneck)

**Tomorrow with MCP (Automated CI/CD Pipeline):**
- ⏱️ **Time:** 5 minutes per customer environment
- ✅ **Errors:** First-attempt success (validated templates, automated checks)
- 😊 **Experience:** Stay in VS Code, conversational commands, local testing before deploy
- 📈 **Scale:** Handle 200+ customers per quarter (automation removes bottleneck entirely)

**This isn't science fiction. This is what we're building.**

---

## Slide 4: The Vision - Three Strategic Scenarios 

We're enabling Fabric's AI-native future through **three interconnected scenarios**:

| # | Scenario | Primary Users | Priority | Why It Matters |
|---|----------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| **1** | **Enable Unified Fabric Copilot** | All Fabric users (via Power BI's Copilot initiative) | **P0** | Organization-wide priority, ~75K Copilot MAU today → 35M total Fabric MAU potential |
| **2** | **Empower Pro Developers** | Data engineers, ISV partners, solution builders | **P0** | Our team's charter, Fabric's strategic shift to pro-dev friendly |
| **3** | **Enable Copilot Studio Ecosystem** | Enterprises, ISVs building custom agents | **P1** | Ecosystem growth, competitive positioning, usage expansion |

**Key Insight:** These aren't isolated use cases. They're a **cohesive strategy** for making Fabric the most AI-agent-friendly analytics platform.

---

## Slide 5: Scenario 1 - Enable Unified Fabric Copilot (P0)

### **The Story**

Power BI is leading an organization-wide initiative to create **ONE unified Copilot** across all of Fabric:
- Users interact with a **single conversational AI** interface
- Create workspaces, build reports, manage data—**across all workloads**
- Seamless experience from the Fabric portal home

**Reference:** [Unified Copilot Spec](https://aka.ms/fabric-unified-copilot-spec) - Active development by Power BI team

---

## Slide 6: Scenario 1 - What They Need From Us

**What Unified Copilot Requires:**

✅ **Execute control plane operations** - Create/update/delete workspaces, items, permissions  
✅ **Extensibility framework** - Workloads contribute domain tools (Power BI DAX, RTI KQL, Data Factory pipelines)  
✅ **Enterprise governance** - Audit logging, rate limiting, compliance (SOC2, ISO 27001)  
✅ **Seamless authentication** - Single OAuth flow, works across all operations  
✅ **Fast response times** - Conversational UX requires <2s responses  
✅ **Error handling** - Actionable messages users can understand  

**The Challenge:** Power BI team needs this infrastructure—they can't build it themselves (not their core competency).

**That's where we come in.**

---

## Slide 7: Scenario 1 - How Our Efforts Address This

**Our Solution:**

| What They Need | How We Address It | Effort |
|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Execute control plane operations | Production-ready tools (workspace, item, permission, capacity operations) | **Remote MCP** |
| Extensibility for workloads | 3-bucket contribution process, shared infrastructure (auth, audit, routing) | **Fabric MCPs Platform** |
| Enterprise governance | Centralized audit logging, rate limiting, admin controls | **Remote MCP** |
| Seamless authentication | OAuth2 flows (user + service principal), token management | **Remote MCP** |

---

## Slide 8: Scenario 1 - Why This is Our TOP PRIORITY

**The Impact Story:**

### **For Users:**

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Stateless:** No session state (scales horizontally)
- **Double-check security:** MCP validates token, API enforces RBAC
- **Resilient:** Retry logic, circuit breakers, health checks
- **Observable:** Telemetry, logging, monitoring at every layer

## Appendix C: Customer Validation Quotes

**From Design Partner Validation (August - October 2025):**

---

**PwC (Global Consulting Firm)**  
*Scenario: Customer onboarding workspace provisioning*

> "Our customer onboarding requires provisioning 15-20 workspaces per engagement. Manual setup takes 2-3 days with frequent permission errors. If we could automate this via an AI agent, we could handle 10x more engagements without adding IT headcount. This could save us $250K+ annually in labor costs alone."

**Impact:** Remote MCP enables automated provisioning via Copilot Studio agents.

---

**Avanade (Microsoft SI Partner)**  
*Scenario: Compliance scanning across multi-tenant environments*

> "We manage 200+ customer Fabric tenants. Quarterly compliance scans take 3 weeks of manual work—exporting data, checking permissions, generating reports. We need continuous, automated scanning, but building custom integrations for each customer is not scalable. An MCP-based solution would let us build once, deploy everywhere."

**Impact:** Remote MCP provides standardized access across all tenants.

---

**The Reporting Hub (ISV Partner)**  
*Scenario: Automated customer environment setup*

> "We onboard 50+ new Fabric customers per quarter. Each requires workspace setup, permission configuration, and template deployment. Manual process takes 6 hours per customer. If we could script this via an AI agent, we'd save $68K annually and reduce onboarding time from days to minutes."

**Impact:** Local + Remote MCP enable CI/CD automation for their onboarding pipeline.

---

**Enterprise Customer (Healthcare, NDA)**  
*Scenario: Employee transition permission handovers*

> "When data engineers leave or change roles, we need to audit and update their permissions across 50+ workspaces. Manual portal workflow takes 2+ hours and is error-prone. We need bulk automation with complete audit trails for compliance. An AI agent that can handle this conversationally would be transformative."

**Impact:** Remote MCP + Claude Desktop enable conversational bulk admin operations.

---

**ISV Partner (Financial Services)**  
*Scenario: AI-assisted Fabric integration development*

> "Our developers spend 40% of their time looking up Fabric API documentation and debugging schema errors. If Copilot in VS Code could generate accurate Fabric code with real-time schema validation, we'd cut integration development time in half. This would let us ship features 2x faster."

**Impact:** Local MCP provides real-time API specs and schema validation to GitHub Copilot.

**All Validation Participants:** 8 sessions, 100% expressed strong interest, 5 committed to private preview participation (January 2026).

## Appendix D: Competitive Landscape

**How Fabric MCP Compares to Other Platforms:**

| Platform | AI Agent Support | Protocol | Status |
|----------|------------------|----------|--------|
| **Microsoft Fabric** | ✅ Production-grade MCP (our effort) | Open MCP standard | Public Preview Q1 2026, GA May 2026 |
| **Snowflake** | Proprietary Cortex Agents | Closed/proprietary | Limited GA |
| **Databricks** | Mosaic AI Agents | Platform-specific | Public Preview |
| **AWS (Redshift)** | Bedrock Agents | AWS-only | GA (locked to AWS) |
| **Google BigQuery** | Vertex AI Agents | Google Cloud only | Limited Preview |

**Fabric's Competitive Advantages:**

1. **Open Standard (MCP)** - Works with ANY agent platform (not vendor lock-in)
2. **First Mover** - First major analytics platform with production-grade MCP support
3. **Comprehensive Coverage** - 23 tools covering all control plane operations (not partial)
4. **Enterprise Trust** - SOC2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP certified (compliance ready)
5. **Microsoft Ecosystem** - Seamless integration with Copilot Studio, Azure AI, Teams

**Strategic Opportunity:** Capture AI-native customer segment BEFORE competitors ship comparable solutions.

**Risk if we don't execute:** Competitors position themselves as "agent-first," Fabric perceived as legacy.
