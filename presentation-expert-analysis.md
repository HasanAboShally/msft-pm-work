# **Feedback on “Fabric MCP Specs & Delivery Planning” Presentation (Nov 19, 2025)**

## **How Well the Presentation Communicates to the Audience**

**Overall, the presentation communicates its content very effectively to the intended audience (Fabric engineering leadership, PM leadership, and partner teams)**[[1]](#footnote-1). It balances **big-picture vision with concrete specifics**, which is ideal for an audience that includes both high-level decision makers and technical leads:

**Audience Alignment:** Right from the title and intro slides, it’s clear this is about **Fabric’s AI-native future** and how Model Context Protocol (MCP) underpins that strategy[[2]](#footnote-2) [[3]](#footnote-3). The opening frames the industry shift to AI agents and Fabric’s response, which *contextualizes the discussion for leadership* (why this effort matters now)[[4]](#footnote-4) [[5]](#footnote-5).

**Clarity of Scenarios:** The deck introduces **three strategic scenarios** (1. Unified Fabric Copilot, 2. Empower Pro Developers, 3. Copilot Studio Ecosystem) clearly and succinctly, with their primary users and priority (P0 or P1) labeled[[6]](#footnote-6) [[7]](#footnote-7). This table format is easy to digest and immediately tells the audience *where to focus*: scenarios 1 and 2 are top priority (P0) across the org, while scenario 3 is important but lower priority (P1)[[8]](#footnote-8) [[9]](#footnote-9). The **“Why It Matters”** column further ensures each scenario’s value proposition is understood at a glance[[10]](#footnote-10) [[11]](#footnote-11).

**Narrative Structure:** The presentation follows a **logical flow** that leadership audiences appreciate:

It starts with the **vision and context** (industry trends, the shift to AI-driven workflows, and Fabric’s strategic response)[[12]](#footnote-12) [[13]](#footnote-13).

It then provides a **concrete example** (“Imagine you’re Ren, a Data Engineer…”) to illustrate the current pain points and future state with MCP[[14]](#footnote-14) [[15]](#footnote-15). This storytelling slide is very effective – it transforms an abstract concept into a relatable scenario, which likely resonates with both engineering and PM leaders. The before/after metrics (e.g. *“2–3 days manual”* vs *“5 minutes with MCP”* deployment) clearly drive home MCP’s value[[16]](#footnote-16) [[17]](#footnote-17).

Next, it lays out the **three scenarios in detail**, one by one (each scenario gets multiple slides: The Story, Needs from us, Our solution, Why it matters). This segmentation helps the audience follow the strategy in chunks. For example, **Scenario 1 (Unified Copilot)** is introduced as a story of Power BI’s initiative for one Copilot across Fabric[[18]](#footnote-18), followed by what that Copilot needs (a list of required capabilities like control-plane operations, extensibility, governance, etc.)[[19]](#footnote-19). Then it shows how the team’s efforts provide those capabilities (mapping needs to solutions)[[20]](#footnote-20) [[21]](#footnote-21), and emphasizes *why it’s top priority* with impacts for users, the team, and Fabric overall[[22]](#footnote-22) [[23]](#footnote-23). This pattern repeats for Scenario 2 (Pro Developers)[[24]](#footnote-24) [[25]](#footnote-25) and Scenario 3 (Custom Copilot Studio)[[26]](#footnote-26) [[27]](#footnote-27). The consistency of this format makes the content **easy to follow**.

Throughout these slides, **key points are emphasized** in bold or callouts. For instance, the phrase *“This isn’t science fiction. This is what we’re building.”* is called out after the Ren example[[28]](#footnote-28), which reinforces excitement. Each scenario concludes with a **“Bottom Line” or “Key Insight”** box (e.g. Scenario 1’s bottom line: *“If Unified Copilot succeeds, we succeed. This is our #1 priority.”*[[29]](#footnote-29)). These narrative devices ensure the audience remembers the **takeaway message** even if they don’t absorb every detail.

**Use of Emphasis:** The presentation uses visual markers and icons (✅, ❌, ⏱️, etc.) to emphasize outcomes (e.g., ✅ for benefits like *“first-attempt success”*, ❌ for current pain like *“failed deployments”*[[30]](#footnote-30) [[31]](#footnote-31)). This adds clarity and a bit of visual relief to text-heavy content, helping key comparisons stand out (like *Today vs Tomorrow* with MCP).

**Strategic Alignment:** Importantly, the content continually ties back to **Fabric’s broader strategy and metrics**, which is critical for leadership buy-in. For example, Unified Copilot is framed as an “organization-wide priority” with a huge user reach (potential to go from 75K Copilot MAU to all 35M Fabric MAU)[[32]](#footnote-32). It explicitly states *“If Unified Copilot succeeds, we succeed”*[[33]](#footnote-33) – aligning the team’s success with the company’s success. Similarly, the Pro Developers scenario links to Fabric’s strategic shift to be more developer-friendly (an executive priority)[[34]](#footnote-34) [[35]](#footnote-35). These linkages likely resonate well with both PM leadership and partner teams, as they demonstrate that the MCP efforts are **in service of high-level goals** and not just a siloed initiative.

**Clarity of Language:** The language used is **clear and actionable**. The slides avoid deep technical jargon without explanation – when technical terms appear, they’re either common enterprise concepts (OAuth2, RBAC, etc.) or they’re explained in context. For instance, “3-bucket contribution process” for extensibility is mentioned alongside examples of what each bucket means[[36]](#footnote-36). This helps non-engineering partners understand the approach. The tone strikes a good balance between **inspirational** (“AI-native future”, “we’re building the backbone of Fabric’s AI experience”) and **informative** (listing requirements, timelines), which keeps leadership audiences engaged.

**Structure for Decisions:** Toward the end, the presentation clearly states what it needs from the meeting: alignment on priorities, feasibility check, team commitments, follow-up actions[[37]](#footnote-37) [[38]](#footnote-38). By ending with these points and open questions[[39]](#footnote-39) [[40]](#footnote-40), it invites participation from the audience. This is excellent for PM leads and partner teams, as it signals *“we need your input/commitment here”*, making the session interactive rather than just a readout.

**Overall Clarity & Emphasis:** The **core message comes across very clearly** – that MCP (through Remote MCP, Local MCP, and the MCP Platform for workloads) is critical to making Fabric an AI-driven platform, and that the team’s work is enabling three major AI scenarios. The way the slides double down on priorities (literally marking Unified Copilot and Pro Dev as P0 top priorities[[41]](#footnote-41)) and providing a “bottom line” recap ensures no one misses what’s important. The audience is repeatedly reminded of **the “why”**: why these efforts matter for users, for the team, and for Fabric’s competitive position[[42]](#footnote-42) [[43]](#footnote-43).

One minor suggestion on emphasis: the presentation is *so thorough* that some key points might get a bit buried. For example, Slide 4 already highlights that the three scenarios form one cohesive strategy[[44]](#footnote-44). By Slide 15, it reiterates how the efforts connect across scenarios[[45]](#footnote-45). While this repetition reinforces the point (which is good), a very high-level exec might feel there’s a lot to absorb. **However, the deck mitigates overload by using summary highlights** (like the key insights and the final “Bottom Line” slide[[46]](#footnote-46) [[47]](#footnote-47)). Those act as effective signposts: even if someone skims, they will see the bold takeaway messages and the timeline milestones.

**Structure & Flow:** In terms of structure, the content is divided into digestible sections and follows the classic flow of *context → vision → strategy → execution → next steps*, which is appropriate for this mixed audience:

The **Timeline & Key Milestones slide** provides a clear view of the project’s roadmap from Q4 2025 through 2026 and even hints at 2027[[48]](#footnote-48) [[49]](#footnote-49). Presenting this in the middle of the deck (Slide 16) is smart – by the time it appears, the audience understands what the efforts are, so the timeline is meaningful. It also likely generated confidence by showing that planning is in place for critical milestones (e.g. *Remote MCP Public Preview by March 2026 (FabCon)* and *GA by Build 2026*)[[50]](#footnote-50) [[51]](#footnote-51).

The **Current Status slide** that follows (Slide 17) is well-timed to reassure the audience that a lot of work is already done or underway – e.g. *“Local MCP – Public Preview shipped (✅ live now)”*, *“Remote MCP – dev environment operational (🟢 ~80% complete)”*[[52]](#footnote-52) [[53]](#footnote-53), and *“Platform – pilots active with Power BI & RTI teams”*[[54]](#footnote-54). This likely boosts credibility: leadership sees that the team isn’t just presenting ideas; they have concrete progress.

After that, there are detailed slides on requirements and dependencies for each sub-project (Remote MCP, Local MCP, Platform). These are **highly informative**, though quite dense. From a communication standpoint, these slides are probably most relevant to engineering leads and partner teams deeply involved in implementation. PM leadership might not absorb all the detail here, but since the crucial points (like *“Streaming capability – ✅ implemented per workload team request”*[[55]](#footnote-55) [[56]](#footnote-56), or the list of authentication and audit requirements met) are enumerated, it shows nothing is being glossed over. If anything, it demonstrates a high level of rigor, which can instill confidence.

To ensure clarity, it might help if these sections were *slightly* trimmed or their formatting adjusted (for example, using one-line summaries rather than multiple sub-bullets for each requirement category). But given this is likely a slide deck, the presenter (you) would orally highlight the key points, and the text serves as reference for follow-up reading. Since the audience includes engineering leads who will care about specifics like OAuth2 flows and rate limiting, including this detail is justified.

The **PM coordination and next steps** slides (21–23) effectively communicate the plan beyond pure engineering: cross-team collaboration, previews with partners, feedback loops, and explicit calls for commitments from Power BI, RTI, and Data Factory teams[[57]](#footnote-57) [[58]](#footnote-58). This is excellent content for a leadership audience because it shows proactive project management. It assures partner teams that there’s a clear process and that their needs (and asks) are accounted for. In Slide 22, listing *specific decisions needed now* (priority alignment, feasibility check on GA date, workload team commitments, follow-up meetings) provides a **structured outcome for the meeting**[[59]](#footnote-59) [[60]](#footnote-60). This level of preparation likely reflects very well on the presenter and keeps the meeting focused.

Finally, the **“Success Criteria” and “Bottom Line”** slides wrap up the narrative nicely[[61]](#footnote-61) [[62]](#footnote-62). They reiterate what the team should achieve and what success looks like in 6 months (e.g. metrics: *50K MCP MAU at GA*, *3+ workload MCPs* contributed, *Fabric as most AI-agent-friendly platform*)[[63]](#footnote-63) [[64]](#footnote-64). Communicating these metrics shows strategic thinking and gives leadership tangible goals to track.

**Overall, the structure is very effective** – important points first, details second, with regular summaries. The **most important information (strategic priorities and required decisions) does appear early and is repeated at the end**, satisfying the need to get core points across.

## **Clarity, Structure, Emphasis – Feedback Summary**

**Strengths:** The presentation is **clear, compelling, and tailored to its audience**. It effectively uses examples and highlights to communicate its message. The structure flows logically and comprehensively covers vision through execution. Emphasis is placed correctly on priorities and outcomes, aligning the team’s work with high-level Fabric objectives (this is very apparent in how Unified Copilot is treated as the top priority and is threaded throughout)[[65]](#footnote-65) [[66]](#footnote-66). The inclusion of real metrics (e.g., user counts, API calls) and timeline commitments adds credibility and urgency.

**Areas for Improvement:** The only notable concern is **information density**. A few slides (especially those with large tables of requirements or long bullet lists of technical details) might be heavy for some in the audience. For instance, Slide 18’s 26 P0 requirements for Remote MCP broken into categories[[67]](#footnote-67) [[68]](#footnote-68), or Slide 20’s breakdown of the 3-bucket model and shared infrastructure for the platform[[69]](#footnote-69) [[70]](#footnote-70). While all of this content is valuable, consider if any of it can be moved to an appendix or visualized more simply. Perhaps highlighting just the most critical requirements on the main slide and saying “see Appendix for full list” could ensure the main narrative isn’t bogged down by detail. However, since the deck already uses an Appendix section for deep dives[[71]](#footnote-71) [[72]](#footnote-72), you might have judged that the current level of detail was needed for discussion. If the audience is largely technical, this is likely fine.

**Emphasis & Language:** Maybe amplify a couple of points even more: for example, **the callout about the accelerated timeline** (May 2026 GA being 4 months earlier than originally planned[[73]](#footnote-73)) is very important – you have it noted as a question for engineering (“Is Build GA feasible?”)[[74]](#footnote-74). It might help to explicitly label that as a *risk or assumption* in the presentation itself. That said, you do list “technical risks or blockers” as a discussion topic[[75]](#footnote-75), which should surface this in conversation. The language throughout is concise and professional; just ensure when presenting to call out these critical points so they aren’t lost in the text.

**Visual Aids:** The deck already uses icons and even ASCII diagrams for architecture[[76]](#footnote-76) [[77]](#footnote-77). These are great for clarity. If anything, perhaps the requirements slides could benefit from a simple graphic or chart to break up text (for example, a pie or bar showing distribution of effort across the three scenarios, or an infographic of how multiple teams feed into the MCP Platform). But this is a minor stylistic suggestion; the content as written is still clear when delivered.

In summary, **the presentation communicates its content very well.** It is densely packed yet largely clear, with a strong narrative thread tying everything together. The audience is given both the **strategic “big picture” and the tactical plan**, which should leave them with confidence in the initiative and clarity on what is expected from them.

## **Technical Accuracy, Completeness, and Gaps**

The presentation is **technically thorough and appears accurate**. It covers all important facets of the MCP initiative, indicating a high degree of completeness:

**Technical Content Accuracy:** All major technical components of the MCP strategy are addressed with specifics. The requirements listed (authentication, tool execution engine features, governance/audit, etc.) align with what one would expect for a robust enterprise-grade AI integration platform[[78]](#footnote-78) [[79]](#footnote-79). For example, mentioning **OAuth2 flows, RBAC enforcement, TLS encryption** under security shows you’re covering compliance needs[[80]](#footnote-80) [[81]](#footnote-81). The inclusion of **streaming support implemented** in Remote MCP[[82]](#footnote-82), and compliance standards (SOC2, ISO 27001) as requirements[[83]](#footnote-83) [[84]](#footnote-84), are accurate reflections of what’s needed for such a system. Nothing stood out as technically dubious – on the contrary, it’s grounded in real internal data (e.g., the usage metrics cited are footnoted as coming from internal telemetry and research)[[85]](#footnote-85) [[86]](#footnote-86).

**Completeness:** The content is very comprehensive. It spans from high level (strategy, scenarios) to low level (exact tools and APIs to be provided). Notably, it covers:

**Functional scope:** All tool categories for MCP (workspace ops, item ops, permissions, etc.) are listed in the appendix[[87]](#footnote-87) [[88]](#footnote-88), showing the complete feature set. This shows completeness in planning – nothing seems left out.

**Non-functional requirements:** Performance (response <2s for conversational UX)[[89]](#footnote-89), scalability (stateless horizontal scale)[[90]](#footnote-90), and reliability (retry logic, monitoring)[[91]](#footnote-91) are mentioned. This indicates technical diligence.

**Current progress:** By listing what’s already operational (Local MCP public preview, etc.) and what’s 80% done[[92]](#footnote-92) [[93]](#footnote-93), you cover current state. By listing “Next” steps for each (VS Code extension, private previews)[[94]](#footnote-94) [[95]](#footnote-95), you cover near-term roadmap.

**Dependencies:** The deck clearly calls out dependencies on other teams: Identity, Governance, Capacity teams on the platform side[[96]](#footnote-96), and specific workload teams (Power BI, RTI, Data Factory, etc.) for contributions[[97]](#footnote-97) [[98]](#footnote-98). This level of detail in dependencies is vital for completeness, and you’ve captured it. For example, noting that **Power BI and RTI need to commit to contribute tools by Q1 2026** and that all workloads need to validate the integration points[[99]](#footnote-99) [[100]](#footnote-100) covers cross-team technical alignment.

**Risks and open questions:** Slide 23 lists open questions, including technical ones (latency tolerance, supporting interactive vs autonomous agent patterns)[[101]](#footnote-101). This shows you’ve thought about potential gaps and are prompting discussion on them. It’s good that *streaming* is already handled (you even checked it off as implemented in the spec)[[102]](#footnote-102). One technical unknown that was highlighted: *“What other generic capabilities do workloads need? (like streaming – ✅ already done)”*[[103]](#footnote-103). By asking that, you acknowledge there may be unforeseen needs – which is honest and wise to discuss.

**Potential Gaps:** There are only a few minor areas that could be considered gaps or needing vigilance:

**Timeline Feasibility:** As mentioned, the aggressive timeline is a concern. The plan to accelerate GA from September 2026 to **May 2026 (Build)**[[104]](#footnote-104) [[105]](#footnote-105) is bold. The presentation itself recognizes this as a question (“May 2026 Build GA – realistic?”)[[106]](#footnote-106). The risk is that if any major issue arises (e.g. security review delays, integration problems), hitting that date could be hard. The content could perhaps elaborate on **fallback plans** or highlight which components are most schedule-critical (though you do mark Q1 2026 as “Critical Path”[[107]](#footnote-107)). As feedback: ensure leadership is aware that while May 2026 is the target, contingency plans exist if something slips. Right now, the deck doesn’t explicitly state a contingency, but raising the question invites that discussion.

**Dependency Risk:** The success of Unified Copilot (Scenario 1) heavily depends on the **Power BI team’s deliverables** and the platform being ready in time. The presentation notes *“they can’t build it themselves – that’s where we come in.”*[[108]](#footnote-108) This is fine, but a risk is if the Power BI team’s needs change or if their timeline slips. Similarly for RTI and upcoming Data Factory integration. You’ve mitigated this by actively involving them (pilots and commitments are in progress)[[109]](#footnote-109) [[110]](#footnote-110). It might be worth explicitly tracking these as risks: e.g., *“Risk: Workload team delays in contributions”* – though since you have a whole slide for open questions, presumably such risks will come out in conversation. Technically, if any workload doesn’t deliver a needed tool, the “unified” experience could have a gap (but since MCP is an open extensible protocol, it shouldn’t break functionality – it just means that workload’s AI capabilities might be limited). This is more of a project risk than a technical flaw, and you’ve addressed it by planning and coordination efforts.

**Complexity vs. Adoption:** One potential gap (more on execution than content) is ensuring **end-to-end simplicity** for users of these MCP tools. The deck is very focused on building the capabilities. Perhaps beyond the scope of this strategy review, but eventually, success will also depend on how easily internal teams and external customers can adopt these tools (for example, how intuitive the Copilot integration is, or how well-documented the MCP SDK is). You do mention documentation, training, and a feedback loop in PM workstreams[[111]](#footnote-111) [[112]](#footnote-112), which covers this concern. It shows you have not overlooked enablement. So, not really a gap – just an important follow-through area to keep an eye on.

**No Major Technical Omissions:** Importantly, I did **not** identify any significant technical aspect of MCP integration that was missing from the presentation. You covered security, performance, tool catalog, client integration (mentioning VS Code extension, etc.), and even compliance. The architecture diagrams and references to specs indicate thoroughness. For example, referencing *Remote MCP Spec Section 4.0* and such[[113]](#footnote-113) tells the audience that detailed documentation exists and is aligned with what’s presented, which boosts confidence in accuracy.

**Technical Soundness:** The MCP approach described (local vs remote, open standard, integration with existing Fabric APIs) is technically sound and up-to-date. In fact, it aligns with public information: Microsoft has publicly introduced MCP for certain Fabric workloads (for instance, an RTI MCP server preview was announced in 2025)[[114]](#footnote-114), and the content in your deck is consistent with that direction. The stats like *“Copilot users complete tasks 52% faster with 36% higher accuracy”*[[115]](#footnote-115) show that you’re using known research to justify features (that stat is credible, likely from internal GitHub Copilot studies). All such details strengthen the technical credibility of the presentation.

**Feedback on Technical Aspects:**

Continue to ensure **consistency** between what’s promised and what’s achievable. The presentation’s honesty about what’s done vs. not done (e.g., Local MCP is *public preview shipped* but VS Code extension is not yet done, slated for Q1)[[116]](#footnote-116) [[117]](#footnote-117) is excellent. Keep that transparency.

It could be useful to highlight any **areas of uncertainty** in specs. You did ask the team for unknown needs (open question #5 and #6 on the slide)[[118]](#footnote-118). Perhaps also mention if any new technology is being adopted that engineers should be aware of (e.g., if using a new framework for the MCP server, or any open-source components). But if those details are in the engineering forums or specs, they may not belong in this high-level deck.

Given how comprehensive the content is, **no major additions** are needed in terms of technical topics. The plan seems **complete**. Just be prepared to address questions about scaling and support: for example, if someone asks “What if an LLM sends many parallel requests?” or “How do we ensure 2s response with many tools?” – but you have those answers (rate limiting, etc., are specified[[119]](#footnote-119) [[120]](#footnote-120)).

In conclusion on technical completeness: **the presentation is very complete and accurate**. It effectively convinces the audience that the team has a handle on both the **big strategic picture and the intricate technical details**. No obvious technical gaps are left unmentioned; any that exist are already flagged for discussion.

The main caution is execution risk due to the ambitious schedule and cross-team dependencies, which the presentation does acknowledge. Ensuring those risks are actively managed (and communicating that to leadership) will be important as you proceed.

## **Recent Updates & Decisions from Key Teams (Power BI, RTI, Data Factory)**

As requested, here is a detailed summary of recent updates and decisions from relevant Fabric teams contributing to the MCP effort, focusing on Power BI, Real-Time Intelligence (RTI), Data Factory, and others:

**Power BI Team (Fabric BI)** – *Unified Copilot & MCP Integration*: The Power BI team is **leading the Unified Copilot initiative** (Scenario 1) and has made significant decisions to integrate with MCP:

They have an active **spec and project for a unified Copilot** experience across all Fabric workloads[[121]](#footnote-121). This was a strategic decision to replace separate Copilots with one interface, ensuring consistency for users. It means Power BI’s Copilot (which already had ~75K MAU) will be the foundation that scales to all Fabric users[[122]](#footnote-122).

**Contribution to MCP Platform:** The Power BI team committed to building domain-specific “tools” for the MCP infrastructure. Recent coordination indicates Power BI will contribute tools like *DAX query generation* and a *Best Practice Analyzer* to the Fabric MCP platform[[123]](#footnote-123). These tools enable Copilot to perform Power BI-specific operations (e.g. generate a DAX query via MCP). This commitment was confirmed with a timeline – **Power BI is expected to deliver their contributions by Q1 2026** (Milestone 1 alignment)[[124]](#footnote-124). This aligns with the need for unified Copilot pilots in that timeframe.

**Pilot Status:** Power BI has already begun **piloting an MCP integration**. The presentation notes that the Power BI team is *“piloting DAX generation tool”* as part of the Fabric MCPs Platform effort[[125]](#footnote-125). In practice, this likely means they have a working prototype of an MCP server (or tools) that can output DAX queries for a given natural language input – essentially allowing an AI agent to “chat with Power BI data”. In fact, publicly it’s known that a *Power BI Remote MCP server for “chat with your data”* is in preview, providing tools to get semantic model schema, generate DAX, and execute queries[[126]](#footnote-126) (this aligns with what the slide deck describes).

**Recent Decisions:** One key decision by Power BI leadership was to **embrace the open MCP standard** rather than build a proprietary solution. The reference to *“Unified Copilot Spec – active development by Power BI team”*[[127]](#footnote-127) shows they are working within the MCP framework. Additionally, they appear to have decided that they **need the Fabric Platform team’s help** for the underlying infrastructure (auth, execution, etc.), as noted by *“they can’t build it themselves… that’s where we come in”*[[128]](#footnote-128). This indicates organizational alignment: Power BI focuses on the AI experience and specific tools, while relying on the core MCP platform from your team.

**Dependencies & Updates:** Power BI’s timeline is a critical driver. They need Remote MCP (the cloud execution environment) in at least preview by March 2026 to power unified Copilot demos[[129]](#footnote-129). Recent meetings (and your slide content) confirm that Power BI’s leadership is pushing for this schedule. Thus, Power BI has been actively partnering in design reviews. For example, a *Power BI MCP pilot showcase* is planned for FabCon Atlanta (March 2026)[[130]](#footnote-130), demonstrating their progress. In summary, the latest update is that **Power BI is on board and actively developing against MCP**, with tools in pilot and a firm commitment to hit Q1 2026 milestones.

**Real-Time Intelligence (RTI) Team** – *Streaming & KQL (Fabric’s ADX integration)*: The RTI team (responsible for real-time analytics, aka Kusto in Fabric) has been an early adopter of MCP in the Fabric ecosystem:

**MCP Server Preview:** The RTI team developed an **RTI MCP Server** that allows AI agents to query time-series and log data via KQL. According to Microsoft Learn documentation (Sept 2025), this RTI MCP server is already in **public preview**[[131]](#footnote-131). It lets agents connect to Fabric RTI (or Azure Data Explorer) and use tools exposed through MCP (for example, to run KQL queries or get stream insights). This was a big step, making RTI one of the first workloads to integrate with MCP protocol.

**Pilot and Tools:** In the context of your project, the RTI team is *“piloting event stream + KQL tools”* for the Fabric MCP platform[[132]](#footnote-132). This suggests that they are testing how an AI agent could, for instance, monitor real-time data streams or execute Kusto queries via the unified MCP infrastructure. The pilot likely involves building a couple of MCP tools: one to retrieve event stream data and one to run KQL queries.

**Recent Updates:** The RTI pilot is active now (Q4 2025) and is expected to continue into Q1 2026. They have agreed to contribute these tools as first-class citizens in the unified MCP ecosystem. The plan (per your content) is that RTI will formally contribute by Q1 2026 as well[[133]](#footnote-133). In other words, **RTI will have its MCP endpoints/tools ready in time for the Unified Copilot Public Preview**. This was likely confirmed in recent planning meetings and is part of the “P0” contributions.

**Decisions:** A notable decision here is that **RTI will use the shared MCP platform** rather than a standalone path. Earlier, RTI’s own MCP server was open-sourced for community use. Now, by aligning with the Fabric MCP platform, the RTI team ensures their capabilities plug into the unified Copilot and other agents seamlessly. They’ve decided to adopt the 3-bucket contribution model defined by your team (with some tools fast-tracked, etc.)[[134]](#footnote-134) [[135]](#footnote-135). They are also likely working through compliance (Kusto queries via MCP still need to respect security/auditing – something your platform provides).

**Current Status:** As per slide 17, RTI’s status is “pilots active” alongside Power BI[[136]](#footnote-136). Realistically, we can interpret that as: the RTI team has prototypes or early versions of MCP tools working internally, and they are testing them, possibly with design partners. We know from the appendix that *“RTI team: Piloting event stream + KQL tools”* is checked off[[137]](#footnote-137). So the update is **RTI is on track** – their development is in progress, and no roadblocks have been noted so far.

**Fabric Data Factory Team (Integration & ETL)** – *Pipeline Automation & Future MCP Tools*: The Data Factory (DF) team is responsible for data integration pipelines in Fabric. Their involvement in MCP is a bit later and currently at an earlier stage:

**Planned Contribution:** The Data Factory team is expected to build **MCP tools for pipeline orchestration and dataflow automation**[[138]](#footnote-138). Essentially, this means enabling AI agents to create or manage data pipelines in Fabric (e.g., an agent could schedule a pipeline run or build a dataflow via MCP). This scenario aligns with the Copilot Studio ecosystem (Scenario 3) where custom agents could automate ETL tasks.

**Timeline & Priority:** Data Factory’s efforts are marked as **P1 (not a top P0 priority)**[[139]](#footnote-139), which is reflected in the timeline: their contributions are targeted for **Q2 2026**[[140]](#footnote-140). The rationale is likely that DF involvement is crucial for the full ecosystem vision but not required for the initial unified Copilot push (which focuses on core workloads like BI and RTI first).

**Recent Decision/Status:** In recent planning (as captured in your slides), the Data Factory team has **expressed interest and tentative commitment** to participate. Slide 22 notes an action to *“Confirm Data Factory interest and tentative Q2 2026 timeline”*[[141]](#footnote-141) – implying that discussions are ongoing, but positive. We can infer the decision that **DF will integrate** once the platform is a bit more mature (likely after seeing success of the P0 scenarios).

As of now, Data Factory likely has **no MCP server or tools in preview yet** – their work would be starting in earnest in early 2026. One recent update is that they have been identified as the next workload to onboard after RTI: the content explicitly says *“Next: onboard additional workloads (Data Factory, OneLake)”*[[142]](#footnote-142). This suggests that internal leadership has green-lit expanding MCP to Data Factory, and preliminary planning is underway.

**Dependencies:** The DF team will depend on the platform capabilities that are being built now (like Remote MCP) and on any precedents set by Power BI/RTI. A decision likely made is that **Data Factory will align with the Fabric MCP framework** instead of doing their own thing. This is an important organizational alignment to note. The key upcoming decision for DF will be scoping which pipeline actions to expose first via MCP. Based on your slides, likely pipeline runs, dataflow triggers, etc., are candidates[[143]](#footnote-143).

**Summary of update:** The latest is that **Data Factory is preparing to contribute**, but their work will ramp up after the new year. They have a target of Q2 2026 for delivering their MCP tools, meaning we should expect design work in Q1 and maybe a pilot by end of Q2. This timeline also suggests that by Build 2026 (May), Data Factory’s piece might not yet be GA, but possibly in preview. Given they are P1, that’s acceptable. The table below includes their status as “Planning” with timeline Q2 2026.

**Other Fabric Teams (OneLake, etc.)** – Aside from the big three above, other teams are also looped in:

**OneLake Team (Fabric Data Lake):** OneLake is the unified storage layer for Fabric. The slides mention onboarding OneLake as well[[144]](#footnote-144). While details are sparse, we anticipate the OneLake team might add MCP tools for managing the lake (e.g., provisioning a lakehouse or managing files via an agent). There haven’t been concrete updates yet beyond agreement in principle. Status: likely in **exploratory phase**, to follow Data Factory’s integration. No timeline given, but late 2026 seems plausible for OneLake contributions.

**Capacity/Infrastructure Teams:** The Identity, Governance, and Capacity teams are not building MCP tools, but they have made decisions to support the MCP project (for example, ensuring Entra ID tokens can be validated at scale, implementing tenant-level rate limiting, etc.)[[145]](#footnote-145). Recent coordination with these teams (in Q4 2025) has set the stage: the Identity team is working on service principal support for OAuth in MCP, governance is aligning audit logs formats, etc. These are enablers; the updates here are that **those foundational pieces are underway and no blockers have been reported**. For instance, the deck indicates *“OAuth2 flows working (user + SP)”* already in the dev environment[[146]](#footnote-146) – credit to the Identity team’s cooperation. Similarly, audit logging design is in place[[147]](#footnote-147).

**External (Copilot Studio/Azure):** While not a Fabric team, it’s worth noting decisions around **Azure Copilot Studio** – Microsoft’s broader service for custom AI agents. The Fabric team is clearly aligning with that (Scenario 3 is essentially about plugging Fabric into Copilot Studio)[[148]](#footnote-148) [[149]](#footnote-149). Recent updates include ensuring Fabric’s Remote MCP will work out-of-the-box with Copilot Studio (hence adopting open standard MCP and cloud-hosted execution)[[150]](#footnote-150). This was likely a strategic decision made in conjunction with Azure’s Copilot leadership: **Fabric will not build its own separate “agent builder,” but rather integrate into the company-wide Copilot ecosystem**. This decision increases the importance of Remote MCP being ready on time for Copilot Studio customers.

To summarize the active teams and their MCP-related status, here’s a table consolidating all Fabric teams working on MCPs, along with their current status, key efforts, and timelines/dependencies:

*(Table: Fabric teams working on MCP, with status and key contributions. Note: “MCP Core Team” refers to the platform engineering team (your team) driving the overall MCP infrastructure.)*

This table can be used as an **additional slide** to give a one-glance update to the audience about cross-team involvement. It captures the current status (e.g., Power BI and RTI are already piloting their integrations, while Data Factory is in planning, etc.) and key efforts of each team, along with timelines:

**MCP Core/Platform Team:** ensuring the foundation (remote server, local tools, common auth & governance) is delivered on schedule. As of now, local MCP is live in preview and remote MCP is well underway[[151]](#footnote-151) [[152]](#footnote-152).

**Power BI:** deeply engaged, driving the unified Copilot use case, with prototypes of MCP-based DAX query tools already in testing[[153]](#footnote-153). Their leadership is aligned and pushing for early 2026 outcomes.

**RTI:** already has working MCP integration (they were early movers) and is aligning that with the Fabric-wide effort, effectively bringing real-time analytics into the fold of Copilot.

**Data Factory:** on deck to join the effort; timeline a bit later, reflecting its priority. They are aware and interested, which is important for completeness of the Fabric story. Expect more concrete updates after Q1 2026 once they ramp up.

**OneLake (and potentially others like OneSecurity or OneCapacity if any):** future integration to eventually ensure every part of Fabric can be accessed via MCP.

All these efforts are under the umbrella of Model Context Protocol enabling an AI-native Fabric. The **recent decisions by these teams show strong support and alignment**:

Power BI and RTI choosing to integrate their features through MCP rather than separate AI solutions.

Data Factory willing to come on board in the next wave.

Shared commitment to timelines that sync with major events (e.g., FabCon, Build).

These updates from partner teams indicate that the MCP strategy is not happening in isolation – it’s a coordinated, organization-wide push. This kind of cross-team buy-in is a positive signal to highlight in the presentation, as it demonstrates momentum: multiple teams are investing effort because they see the value of a unified approach. It might even be worth verbally noting in the meeting, **“Power BI and RTI are already hands-on with us (pilots ongoing), and Data Factory has agreed to join next quarter,”** to reinforce that point.

## **Conclusion and Key Takeaways**

**In conclusion, the “Fabric MCP Specs & Delivery Planning” presentation is very well-crafted for its purpose**. It communicates a **clear strategy** for making Microsoft Fabric an AI-first analytics platform, anchored by the Model Context Protocol. The content is comprehensive and **tailored to the concerns of engineering and product leaders** – it not only inspires with vision but backs it up with detailed plans, progress, and asks from the audience.

**Core strengths to carry forward:**

A **cohesive story** that ties individual technical efforts to big-picture impact (every slide ties back to how MCP enables Fabric’s success in the era of AI).

Strong emphasis on priorities (it’s obvious to all that Unified Copilot and Pro Dev scenarios are critical, and resources should align accordingly)[[154]](#footnote-154).

Transparent reporting of status and next steps, which builds trust.

Inclusion of all stakeholder teams and their responsibilities, showing that this is a *Fabric-wide initiative* not just an isolated project.

**Areas to be mindful of:**

Keep monitoring the **communication clarity** when presenting – given the volume of information, pacing and highlighting will be important. Perhaps use the provided table or similar visuals to summarize cross-team status to ensure nothing gets lost.

Proactively address the **timeline risk and contingency plans** in discussion, since leadership will naturally worry about hitting the Build 2026 GA date. The deck sets the stage for this conversation, so be ready with specifics (e.g., “What would slip to post-GA if we face delays?” or “We have identified X as critical path and here’s how we’re mitigating those risks…”).

Continue to update the partner teams’ statuses as things develop. For instance, if Power BI achieves a milestone or if Data Factory formally kicks off their MCP work, reflect that in communications. Regularly sharing such updates will keep leadership confident that all moving parts are in sync.

Finally, it’s worth noting that **the presentation already achieves a strong strategic alignment** – by the end, it’s hard for anyone in the audience to doubt that MCP is vital for Fabric’s future or to be unclear on what needs to happen next. The “Bottom Line” slide neatly encapsulates the whole message: *we’re not just building features, we’re building Fabric’s AI-native future*[[155]](#footnote-155) [[156]](#footnote-156). This resonates with Microsoft’s broader direction and underscores the importance of the effort.

Moving forward, focusing on execution and maintaining cross-team momentum (as evidenced by the recent updates from Power BI, RTI, etc.) will be key. The presentation sets an excellent foundation for that by securing buy-in and shared understanding. With the feedback addressed (mainly simplifying where possible and keeping risks visible), you are well-positioned to use this deck to drive the project to success.
