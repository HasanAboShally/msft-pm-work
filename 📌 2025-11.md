// this is a draft of my personal notes as a senior PM in Fabric's Platform automation team, where I'm focusing on developer experience and automation scenarios, and currently lead the work on the Fabric CLI and the efforts around MCPs (Model context protocol) in Fabric.


 
# PM — Hasan

Spec --> requirements --> handover


Direct to MWC (?) I need to better understand.



Personal notes:
- Kim likes Mocks/Flows/Steps



Action Items:

- Hasan: update after meeting with OneLake team (will post on MCP Weekly chat)
- Hasan+Ran: discuss getting item relationships (parent-child for now) in our public API
- Hasan+Alon+Eva: decide on the requirement regarding usage telemetry (e.g., ADO-->CLI-->SDK counts as what?)
- Hasan+Chen/Maher: organize ADO based on Doron's requirement





Learn more about the personas:
- Citizen dev
- Dev
...


Sync with Ali Hammud on MCPs (Review specs)


Telemetry across tools.


Backlog with AlonY and Chen


Fill Connect




### prep for execution
- Prepare customer feedback about the CLI + MCP (for execution review)
- Present a slide with the Usage dashboard initiatives
- Prepare to a slide telemetry of local MCP
- Slide on MCP status
- Demos: MCP demo (video) + CLI OSS (first PR)



SHOW SHOW SHOW (mockups etc...)


Create mockup for MCP Server Item


------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------


# Additional Efforts


## FabCon Atlanta Talk
(with Alon Baram)



Ask Kim: what she thinks

We need to not differentiate from CI/CD story (not just deployment)
Ask Yaron if he submitted a session (so we don't conflict

Hasan: Main, Alon: Co


##


------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------




# CLI



## Tasks
- Review GitHub issues
- CLI Spec/Vision (with portal, OSS, item ...)
- Written plan to increase engagement
- - ADO extension
- - Samples repo
- - Deploy command
- - ...
- Publish CLI issues we have (with spec)
- Send follow-up to Kurt





Prepare for the meeting with Amir about the CI/CD





CI/CD gaps with CLI: will meet with Jacob to further discuss.


## CLI in the web

### Action Items
1. Hasan to put the high-level doc/definition (by next week)
2. Menglu to review
3. Meet with Avishag

### KrQ1 Goal
Understand scenario and goal of the feature (usage vs statement.. I'll not put it that way to leadership). Also crystalize and validate problem statement.




## Running remote CLI scripts
- CLI item (pre-config + script)
- CLI from UDFs
- CLI from NB

---


I need to define the requirements (is it context aware for example etc...)



Making Fabric more developer friendly experience:


Nothing taken for granted.
Usage-driven, it's not about signaling to developers that they are welcomed.









------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------



# Fabric MCP(s)



## Hosted MCP


Ryan Pfalz (sync with Aviv?)



## Action Items:
- formalize the contribution process




How teams extend our capabilities by additional teams
Copilot unification work, we need to take ownership on the MCP server there ()




Yes. We have discussed the approach for the hosted MCP, and are now formalizing the process. I'm putting it together in a doc which we can share with other teams 👍 will send the doc her by Monday.
 
In a nutshell the process depends whether the capability the workload team want to add exist in the public API:
If Yes: they submit a proposal to us (currently by contacting me directly), and we add it to our API/Execution MCP if relevant. 
If not (i.e., tool with custom login): we guide them how to implement their own MCP on top of our infra (which currently provide s auth and routing)



Goal: support whatever the public APIs support.

- Separate MCP for Admin (tenant admin)
- 


Missing: 
Graph APIs


Private links — not sure if we can support by public preview (Mahir is checking — TBD in the mcp-weekly meeting)

in Q2:
- Add admin switch (allow MCP on the tenant level). Workspace setting as well?
-


Current design approach: 1 tool = 1 API (for the public preview), we can adapt later as needed.












---




# Local MCP

Do we mind adding execution commands?












Amos: VScode extensions texts etc.

Telemetry



Specs for the MCPs — will review with Amos and Mahir and then share with everyone for review.



Tali: User agent propagation

Telemetry: new usage dashboard.



Ran set command — partial updates for definition editing. Definition patching (partials).



CLI to propose functionality that is done by 



item child-parent mapping: follow-up with munir.



Chen: meeting tomorrow.

No discoverability





Ask Aitor about why these 3 properties









set command is so powerful,

If you don't know what you're doing you can miss up.



It will be great to open it up.

Aliases makes sense.





set command to change...





Disclaimer: you can change anything but it could change.. 



Ensure to have git integration

Are you sure?









Changes in definitions could break customers...







Validate you obtained the property via get command.. try to duplicate the command











put research questions for the call with Avishag.






Send to the OSS business review..

Aviat questions

1. what do you mean by: Same query works consistently across all output formats - we  want to support filtering the output format obj?
2. what is global -q ? "Command-specific -q takes precedence over global -q"
3. Performance - we are using Jmespath so I don't have control on how they filter the data?



one more Q - what we decided regarding -l flag? -q will always  override it? 
meaning if we get -q we always run the second API call 
-q is like user write -l with filter



Global vs command specific
fab ls -l -q  vs  fab ls -q











# Review with Aviv

Support unified copilot

Control-plane (in the public APIs) vs all te public APIs 

extensibiltiy: tool conflicting (git-connected workspace creation)





Story in fabcon (blog)
—> requirements
—> spec
—> priorities backlog
—> Plan (Engineering)

Negotiate




Requirements in the spec > processes (work with engineering, they lead it)


What will enable the workloads to work (workload enablers)
What’s our role in the process (review etc..)

Does the contribution process need to be in the spep

Convert requirements to “as a user I can…”




User stories: a developer gets into vscode and connects to mcp via vscode…
What the users does in the flow…


How many users are building agents in Copilot studio 

(Think of the demo)

Then it’s clear the connection to the requirements…





1. User (pro-dev) —> Action/flow —> requirements
2. Workload enablers. Unified Copilot is a customer (currently developed by PBI — workload)
3. Platform (?) with the Herzliya team. Admin API. (Separate MCP)
4. 




Platform


Requirement: all what I can do with the API I want to be able to do with agent.


Why do we need 




We want to be reviewers to the separate MCP (we’re the owners — similar to the APIs story).




In Spec:
- Problem statement 
- Business justification (value…)
- Scenarios - priority - user/persona - tool (vscode, copilot…)
    - Fabric copilot (we’re enablers)
    - Workload (in wiki?)
    - VScode (we’re owners of the persona)
    - 

Platform.. (auth, datastreaming)

Workload enablement (tools of PowerBI)
Workloads who are building their own agents and want 



2 specs: Fabric Hosted MCP vs Fabric library to build you MCP in Fabric





Look at CI/CD what they did.




Interactive vs autonomous in hosted map



Complex scenarios



Control plane MCP instead of hosted MCP.


Data agents (ask Marcus about multiple MCP servers scenario) 







Local MCP.

Can I show something at 3pm 







///



CLI in the web





CLI in NB









Process of MCP contribution.





CI/CD library — 





CLI as library..





Why run CLI from Notebook while we have python SDK.









MCP requirements:

 bare url /mcp/powerbi/ (without workspaces etc...)
next step: talk to MWC to check
Open feature in ADO

Unified copilot: help generate content in Fabric.
Blueprint: requirements around items and things in the workspace. How does this relate to automation..
* Filtering by display name (search api from catalog team) — Check with Nadav.
* OneLake APIs, beyond Fabric APIs. MCP of OneLake. Graph MCP. (need solving the workspace thing)






Pre plan for Q2-planing. 



//



Meeting with Rivka and Avishag.


Can do survey.

Ask Aviv regarding reddit post



// CLI in the web: - research:











⁠Mental model of users: how the perceive CLI vs Copilot
What's the tasks the personas are doing (what's the workflow)

ProDev persona

Why will ProDev goes into the portal.

Why non pro-dev would use the CLI (over copilot)

What will get you into the portal.

Check existing fabric feedback on pro-dev and portal

Scoping CLI work only to specific workspaces

Other potential personas

export audit logs

we don't know what the copilot gives.
can we think co-pilot not exist?


Meet with customers: pro-devs and citizen -devs.

User

Research on the exiting CLI 

What people do with the CLI today + What pro-dev

Talk to some users that use the CLI today 


Is there value?
To who?
How? and how will it talk with Copilot?

Build research plan
(( Meet on research plan ))







----


Main Focus: CLI increase usage.​

- Open source: managing contributions, engaging the community​

- Integrations: VSCode extension, ADO, Notebooks, UDFs​

- Scripts library: sample scripts for common use-cases (open-sourced repo)​

- UX research on additional personas beyond ProDev and DevOps (e.g., admins, data scientists)​

- Publicity: keep pushing blogs, meetings with customer voice etc… ​

​


Satisfaction:​

- Survey among current users (feedback + measuring NSAT)​
- Plan new features & extensions












---------------------------------------------------





# CLI in the web



We need to be consistent
In terms of pricing
CLI in the service will need a spark to run on. Who will pay for that?


Billing of using copilot. (What’s their pricing model.. maybe we can learn from it)



Copilot will take time. (Maybe we don’t need to wait for them? It’s still unclear what capabilities they will provide, and when?)


CLI in NB could be first step towards CLI in the web, and help us validate.


Persona of Notebook; who is using notebook today and what can the cli bring to them? Can the cli expand their personas? (e.g., control plane operations in notebooks).
  



IMPORTANT QUESTION:
Who’s our persona for the CLI today.
Is it pro-dev, IT/Admin,  Workspace administrator, Capacity admin??? (Need to check fabric personas website)



Enterprise voice: we’re running a CLI in the service survey. 
Talk to them. Need to understand who in the enterprise use the CLI.


Talk to Mathew (ask what to do)
Write in enterprise voice.


We still don’t know who is the persona.


Why / Why not do CLI in the web?







AI Agent is can be a persona of the CLI.


I need to bring usage.

Bring

40K users




How do I want to create usage.


Create a Fabric CLI council of pro users
Meets monthly to discuss





top priority to enable unified copilot:

- search api / filtering capability
- OneLake APIs

- mcp url without workspace for workloads: 
- - solve to all: send involation to the workload OR understand the tool and figure out the capacity from workload
- - solve specifically for OneLake


MWC 


Prepare for tomorrow's meeting with OneLake team (Ofri).
Put in ADO.

How are we progressing.







+ idea for vscode extension:

Start with the unified copilot scenario, not with the efforts.


Remote MCP: work with Developer - Jian (Jee-ahn)
Add scenario.



Ask other persona-owners what their persona needs from our MCP.


Take Nimrod’s file (Yaron): search CI/CD MCP.
Execution in VS code.
Deployment story: of “contributor” role / it org - prodev / workspace admin.



Interactive scenario vs automation scenario.
Human of the loop - requirement from customers.



Efforts:
* Support
* Platform
* Devs




Focus everyone in the meeting tomorrow.

Talk about the scenarios and from their derive efforts.


Binh is the persona for 


Requiremetns from:
1- form us (pro-dev scenarios)
2- from additional platform teams… 
3- platform enablement


Tell me the problem, the scenario (?),



We need to understand  what’s the story and what problem do they want to solve.



My job is to udnersatnad the scenario and that all the team here understand’s the scenario
Understand the scenario helps us priorities.. based on items usage etc..


Need to talk with the teams/workloads..



Join spec reviews of workloads PMs




Understanding WHY I’m doing the features.
To priorities te backlog.



Understand usage?? 

—> drive usage



CLI scenarios on PBI




We need to get the team excited to work on it!



PBI MAU - Copilot MAU

USAGE


Roi.. bring me users of PBI desktop, or in VS code, in CLI.
Priorities.








Add a slide in about the story (What+Why) e.g., enable unified copilot… . + present scenarios.








Sujata - working on the copilot





Build Fabric MCPs Channel






(( Need persona validation ))

Talk to more customers on this.



Story of the bigger story

Take Rui’s slide (to tell the story).

We want usage as well.






First step. 
Towards getting to the final review.. 


Start from the scenarios and priorities.
Efforts..




Requirements of all efforts ( split if it’s our’s , platform, or workloads)




Ask other team’s what’s there pro-dev scenarios


What their pro-devs are doing?
Or what control plan scenarios they have.



We need to add our persona to the fabric personas


לרתום את האשים ולעשות להם סדר בראש.
לייצר בהירות



בוא נעשה סדר 
נתמקד באיזורי השקעה.

שני scenarios
+ requirements


Requirement <> efforts <> scenarios <> story

Understand + Excited!


Everyone want’s MAU!!!

# FabCLI PowerBI — meeting with Rui Romano

- Rebind command
- 

Fabric get does some of the replacement (bypath --> byconnection)

check rui romano github for more scenarios



powerbi commands vs 


SemanticModelID vs ws1/sm1.semanticmodel




Want any item to be deployed in one line of CLI.



PBI report always connected


rebind - we need to support v2





Query command


do we support PBI commands?


Review the PowerBI APIs.





(2) Semantic models parameters






PowerPI developer using 




remove a visual/table before deployment


start with genetic commands 

most of pbi developers/users should be familiar with the definition.
we can assume that
need a flexible way for them to make chanes (JMSEPATH is good)



Deploy a report and make sure the selected page is specific page.

make a page of example converting the generic apporach to more foamous use-cases



sementaic model definition is not JSON, it's tmdl. We might need to convert?
regex support? 



 generic set command
 it should also work with the 
 "predeplyment script" -- preset 
 adhoc change just for the improt
 - set command as a paramater of the import

3 semesters vision deck — until end of January.



We own the epics and features.


PM touch features and epics,
Engineers to,



We need to make the change.


Define the same structure for everyone.

















https://hits.microsoft.com/my/preferences



but something simple that would help is doing the same as pip install, when you call the CLI the first time in a session report back to the user there is a new version.
