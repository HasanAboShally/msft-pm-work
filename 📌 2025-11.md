// this is a draft of my personal notes as a senior PM in Fabric's Platform automation team, where I'm focusing on developer experience and automation scenarios, and currently lead the work on the Fabric CLI and the efforts around MCPs (Model context protocol) in Fabric.


 
# PM — Hasan

Spec --> requirements --> handover


Direct to MWC (?) I need to better understand.



Personal notes:
- Kim likes Mocks/Flows/Steps



Action Items:

- Hasan: update after meeting with OneLake team (will post on MCP Weekly chat)
- Hasan+Ran: discuss getting item relationships (parent-child for now) in our public API
- Hasan+Alon+Eva: decide on the requirement regarding usage telemetry (e.g., ADO-->CLI-->SDK counts as what?)
- Hasan+Chen/Maher: organize ADO based on Doron's requirement





Learn more about the personas:
- Citizen dev
- Dev
...


Sync with Ali Hammud on MCPs (Review specs)


Telemetry across tools.


Backlog with AlonY and Chen


Fill Connect




### prep for execution
- Prepare customer feedback about the CLI + MCP (for execution review)
- Present a slide with the Usage dashboard initiatives
- Prepare to a slide telemetry of local MCP
- Slide on MCP status
- Demos: MCP demo (video) + CLI OSS (first PR)



SHOW SHOW SHOW (mockups etc...)


Create mockup for MCP Server Item


------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------


# Additional Efforts


## FabCon Atlanta Talk
(with Alon Baram)



Ask Kim: what she thinks

We need to not differentiate from CI/CD story (not just deployment)
Ask Yaron if he submitted a session (so we don't conflict

Hasan: Main, Alon: Co


##


------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------




# CLI



## Tasks
- Review GitHub issues
- CLI Spec/Vision (with portal, OSS, item ...)
- Written plan to increase engagement
- - ADO extension
- - Samples repo
- - Deploy command
- - ...
- Publish CLI issues we have (with spec)
- Send follow-up to Kurt





Prepare for the meeting with Amir about the CI/CD





CI/CD gaps with CLI: will meet with Jacob to further discuss.


## CLI in the web

### Action Items
1. Hasan to put the high-level doc/definition (by next week)
2. Menglu to review
3. Meet with Avishag

### KrQ1 Goal
Understand scenario and goal of the feature (usage vs statement.. I'll not put it that way to leadership). Also crystalize and validate problem statement.




## Running remote CLI scripts
- CLI item (pre-config + script)
- CLI from UDFs
- CLI from NB

---


I need to define the requirements (is it context aware for example etc...)



Making Fabric more developer friendly experience:


Nothing taken for granted.
Usage-driven, it's not about signaling to developers that they are welcomed.









------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------



# Fabric MCP(s)



## Hosted MCP


Ryan Pfalz (sync with Aviv?)



## Action Items:
- formalize the contribution process




How teams extend our capabilities by additional teams
Copilot unification work, we need to take ownership on the MCP server there ()




Yes. We have discussed the approach for the hosted MCP, and are now formalizing the process. I'm putting it together in a doc which we can share with other teams 👍 will send the doc her by Monday.
 
In a nutshell the process depends whether the capability the workload team want to add exist in the public API:
If Yes: they submit a proposal to us (currently by contacting me directly), and we add it to our API/Execution MCP if relevant. 
If not (i.e., tool with custom login): we guide them how to implement their own MCP on top of our infra (which currently provide s auth and routing)



Goal: support whatever the public APIs support.

- Separate MCP for Admin (tenant admin)
- 


Missing: 
Graph APIs


Private links — not sure if we can support by public preview (Mahir is checking — TBD in the mcp-weekly meeting)

in Q2:
- Add admin switch (allow MCP on the tenant level). Workspace setting as well?
-


Current design approach: 1 tool = 1 API (for the public preview), we can adapt later as needed.












---




# Local MCP

Do we mind adding execution commands?












Amos: VScode extensions texts etc.

Telemetry



Specs for the MCPs — will review with Amos and Mahir and then share with everyone for review.



Tali: User agent propagation

Telemetry: new usage dashboard.



Ran set command — partial updates for definition editing. Definition patching (partials).



CLI to propose functionality that is done by 



item child-parent mapping: follow-up with munir.



Chen: meeting tomorrow.

No discoverability





Ask Aitor about why these 3 properties









set command is so powerful,

If you don't know what you're doing you can miss up.



It will be great to open it up.

Aliases makes sense.





set command to change...





Disclaimer: you can change anything but it could change.. 



Ensure to have git integration

Are you sure?









Changes in definitions could break customers...







Validate you obtained the property via get command.. try to duplicate the command











put research questions for the call with Avishag.






Send to the OSS business review..

Aviat questions

1. what do you mean by: Same query works consistently across all output formats - we  want to support filtering the output format obj?
2. what is global -q ? "Command-specific -q takes precedence over global -q"
3. Performance - we are using Jmespath so I don't have control on how they filter the data?



one more Q - what we decided regarding -l flag? -q will always  override it? 
meaning if we get -q we always run the second API call 
-q is like user write -l with filter



Global vs command specific
fab ls -l -q  vs  fab ls -q











# Review with Aviv

Support unified copilot

Control-plane (in the public APIs) vs all te public APIs 

extensibiltiy: tool conflicting (git-connected workspace creation)





Story in fabcon (blog)
—> requirements
—> spec
—> priorities backlog
—> Plan (Engineering)

Negotiate




Requirements in the spec > processes (work with engineering, they lead it)


What will enable the workloads to work (workload enablers)
What’s our role in the process (review etc..)

Does the contribution process need to be in the spep

Convert requirements to “as a user I can…”




User stories: a developer gets into vscode and connects to mcp via vscode…
What the users does in the flow…


How many users are building agents in Copilot studio 

(Think of the demo)

Then it’s clear the connection to the requirements…





1. User (pro-dev) —> Action/flow —> requirements
2. Workload enablers. Unified Copilot is a customer (currently developed by PBI — workload)
3. Platform (?) with the Herzliya team. Admin API. (Separate MCP)
4. 




Platform


Requirement: all what I can do with the API I want to be able to do with agent.


Why do we need 




We want to be reviewers to the separate MCP (we’re the owners — similar to the APIs story).




In Spec:
- Problem statement 
- Business justification (value…)
- Scenarios - priority - user/persona - tool (vscode, copilot…)
    - Fabric copilot (we’re enablers)
    - Workload (in wiki?)
    - VScode (we’re owners of the persona)
    - 

Platform.. (auth, datastreaming)

Workload enablement (tools of PowerBI)
Workloads who are building their own agents and want 



2 specs: Fabric Hosted MCP vs Fabric library to build you MCP in Fabric





Look at CI/CD what they did.




Interactive vs autonomous in hosted map



Complex scenarios



Control plane MCP instead of hosted MCP.


Data agents (ask Marcus about multiple MCP servers scenario) 







Local MCP.

Can I show something at 3pm 







///



CLI in the web





CLI in NB









Process of MCP contribution.





CI/CD library — 





CLI as library..





Why run CLI from Notebook while we have python SDK.









MCP requirements:

 bare url /mcp/powerbi/ (without workspaces etc...)
next step: talk to MWC to check
Open feature in ADO

Unified copilot: help generate content in Fabric.
Blueprint: requirements around items and things in the workspace. How does this relate to automation..
* Filtering by display name (search api from catalog team) — Check with Nadav.
* OneLake APIs, beyond Fabric APIs. MCP of OneLake. Graph MCP. (need solving the workspace thing)






Pre plan for Q2-planing. 



//



Meeting with Rivka and Avishag.


Can do survey.

Ask Aviv regarding reddit post



// CLI in the web: - research:











⁠Mental model of users: how the perceive CLI vs Copilot
What's the tasks the personas are doing (what's the workflow)

ProDev persona

Why will ProDev goes into the portal.

Why non pro-dev would use the CLI (over copilot)

What will get you into the portal.

Check existing fabric feedback on pro-dev and portal

Scoping CLI work only to specific workspaces

Other potential personas

export audit logs

we don't know what the copilot gives.
can we think co-pilot not exist?


Meet with customers: pro-devs and citizen -devs.

User

Research on the exiting CLI 

What people do with the CLI today + What pro-dev

Talk to some users that use the CLI today 


Is there value?
To who?
How? and how will it talk with Copilot?

Build research plan
(( Meet on research plan ))







----


Main Focus: CLI increase usage.​

- Open source: managing contributions, engaging the community​

- Integrations: VSCode extension, ADO, Notebooks, UDFs​

- Scripts library: sample scripts for common use-cases (open-sourced repo)​

- UX research on additional personas beyond ProDev and DevOps (e.g., admins, data scientists)​

- Publicity: keep pushing blogs, meetings with customer voice etc… ​

​


Satisfaction:​

- Survey among current users (feedback + measuring NSAT)​
- Plan new features & extensions












---------------------------------------------------





# CLI in the web



We need to be consistent
In terms of pricing
CLI in the service will need a spark to run on. Who will pay for that?


Billing of using copilot. (What’s their pricing model.. maybe we can learn from it)



Copilot will take time. (Maybe we don’t need to wait for them? It’s still unclear what capabilities they will provide, and when?)


CLI in NB could be first step towards CLI in the web, and help us validate.


Persona of Notebook; who is using notebook today and what can the cli bring to them? Can the cli expand their personas? (e.g., control plane operations in notebooks).
  



IMPORTANT QUESTION:
Who’s our persona for the CLI today.
Is it pro-dev, IT/Admin,  Workspace administrator, Capacity admin??? (Need to check fabric personas website)



Enterprise voice: we’re running a CLI in the service survey. 
Talk to them. Need to understand who in the enterprise use the CLI.


Talk to Mathew (ask what to do)
Write in enterprise voice.


We still don’t know who is the persona.


Why / Why not do CLI in the web?







AI Agent is can be a persona of the CLI.


I need to bring usage.

Bring

40K users




How do I want to create usage.


Create a Fabric CLI council of pro users
Meets monthly to discuss





top priority to enable unified copilot:

- search api / filtering capability
- OneLake APIs

- mcp url without workspace for workloads: 
- - solve to all: send involation to the workload OR understand the tool and figure out the capacity from workload
- - solve specifically for OneLake


MWC 


Prepare for tomorrow's meeting with OneLake team (Ofri).
Put in ADO.

How are we progressing.







+ idea for vscode extension:

Start with the unified copilot scenario, not with the efforts.


Remote MCP: work with Developer - Jian (Jee-ahn)
Add scenario.



Ask other persona-owners what their persona needs from our MCP.


Take Nimrod’s file (Yaron): search CI/CD MCP.
Execution in VS code.
Deployment story: of “contributor” role / it org - prodev / workspace admin.



Interactive scenario vs automation scenario.
Human of the loop - requirement from customers.



Efforts:
* Support
* Platform
* Devs




Focus everyone in the meeting tomorrow.

Talk about the scenarios and from their derive efforts.


Binh is the persona for 


Requiremetns from:
1- form us (pro-dev scenarios)
2- from additional platform teams… 
3- platform enablement


Tell me the problem, the scenario (?),



We need to understand  what’s the story and what problem do they want to solve.



My job is to udnersatnad the scenario and that all the team here understand’s the scenario
Understand the scenario helps us priorities.. based on items usage etc..


Need to talk with the teams/workloads..



Join spec reviews of workloads PMs




Understanding WHY I’m doing the features.
To priorities te backlog.



Understand usage?? 

—> drive usage



CLI scenarios on PBI




We need to get the team excited to work on it!



PBI MAU - Copilot MAU

USAGE


Roi.. bring me users of PBI desktop, or in VS code, in CLI.
Priorities.








Add a slide in about the story (What+Why) e.g., enable unified copilot… . + present scenarios.








Sujata - working on the copilot





Build Fabric MCPs Channel






(( Need persona validation ))

Talk to more customers on this.



Story of the bigger story

Take Rui’s slide (to tell the story).

We want usage as well.






First step. 
Towards getting to the final review.. 


Start from the scenarios and priorities.
Efforts..




Requirements of all efforts ( split if it’s our’s , platform, or workloads)




Ask other team’s what’s there pro-dev scenarios


What their pro-devs are doing?
Or what control plan scenarios they have.



We need to add our persona to the fabric personas


לרתום את האשים ולעשות להם סדר בראש.
לייצר בהירות



בוא נעשה סדר 
נתמקד באיזורי השקעה.

שני scenarios
+ requirements


Requirement <> efforts <> scenarios <> story

Understand + Excited!


Everyone want’s MAU!!!

Fabric get does some of the replacement (bypath --> byconnection)

check rui romano github for more scenarios



powerbi commands vs 


SemanticModelID vs ws1/sm1.semanticmodel




Want any item to be deployed in one line of CLI.



PBI report always connected


rebind - we need to support v2





Query command


do we support PBI commands?


Review the PowerBI APIs.





(2) Semantic models parameters






PowerPI developer using 




remove a visual/table before deployment


start with genetic commands 

most of pbi developers/users should be familiar with the definition.
we can assume that
need a flexible way for them to make chanes (JMSEPATH is good)



Deploy a report and make sure the selected page is specific page.

make a page of example converting the generic apporach to more foamous use-cases



sementaic model definition is not JSON, it's tmdl. We might need to convert?
regex support? 



 generic set command
 it should also work with the 
 "predeplyment script" -- preset 
 adhoc change just for the improt
 - set command as a paramater of the import

# MCP Presentation

I need to talk about our role in the 3 scenarios (enablers for unified copilot, we own the pro dev persona, we're platform team and are enablers to other workloads and agentic experineces -externally and internally-)

Vision + why MCP slide = combine both together.

--- 

Slide on the learning goals of the priavate preview of remote MCP, including:
M0 is a learning milestone. Key questions to validate with design partners:

| # | Topic | What We Want to Learn | How We'll Measure |
|---|-------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Audit & Compliance** | Do customers need agent-specific audit entries? What audit details matter most? | Partner interviews, audit log analysis |
| 2 | **Error Messages** | Are error messages actionable enough for agents to self-recover? | Agent success rate, retry patterns |
| 3 | **Latency Tolerance** | What latency is acceptable for interactive vs. autonomous agents? | p50/p95 latency vs. task completion |
| 4 | **Context Binding** | How do users expect workspace/item context to flow to agents? | Usability testing, support tickets |
| 5 | **Permission Patterns** | What permission operations do users attempt most? | Tool call frequency analysis |
| 6 | **Filtering Needs** | What filters do users need for list operations? | Query pattern analysis |
| 7 | **Batch Size** | What's the typical batch size for bulk operations? | Usage telemetry |

---


Explain low usage. (we jsut published the packages)
There is a lot of exceitment from the people:  show Linken post of Kim.
Share some additional insigts from the call with partners (e.g., Feedback on single entry point )
Vanity + what we learned.
--> What are going to do based on the learnings (most improtant)


Talk why we're doing the things next semester.
Explaing WHY we're doing the what we're doing.
Make sure to split the content in a good way between me and Tal.
I need to talk about the WHY, Tal about the how and what.


--

Add slide on MCP vision:
- remote MCP (single endpoint) to connect you to all things in Fabric.
- local MCP: help pro-devs work seamleslly with Fabric and build on top of it.
- enable internal workloads to provide agentic capabilites
- enable customers to create custom agents that work with Fabric.


WHY --> HOW --> Status --> What's Next (for each effort)



Think about Kim and Laurent as in how they can push the agenda you want.


meet with Yuri and Maher


it's still in defintion

# Notes from PM roundtable with KIM




Developers in the portal vs vscode

Ai workflows for pms 

datapipelines example for the pro devs 


Confusion on the owning archetecture (archs vs pms)


----------------------------------------------------------------








Customer feedback





Appstore model?
long tail (?)



Internal tooling for workloads vs customer values

PM ai workflows - standiraztions


Open an Fabric/MS AI PM Teams channel (?)








non-platformic efforts (PBIE?)


new fronts: like MCP - who needs to drive archetitcs awareness?









# Insights:

* You have to be as technichal as your customer
* (( start with spec templates (?) ))
* (( Spending more time with customers ))
* Watch recording of the platform planning with Arun
* work more with the **CAT team** to get more customer feedback
* strive to spend 1/3 of your time with customers
* do a drill of "going to great" based on customer feedback
* check roadmap with enterprise voice session as well
how might we leverage knowdlge that the workload teams have?


## Our job as a PM:
-- priority
-- customer problems
-- why this is important
-- drive the clarity on what your'e optimizing for
-- drive the clarity on vision (for us and the team)
-- Balance between: do the things that customers want vs things that the customers is not asking aobut and change the market





Persona clarification 
Platform knowledge as a platform team

Same for the CLI?


(( Fabric Community Showcase ))




# PM Day — Thu 11 Dec, 2025


Who owns the decision?
Are they convinced with the why?

The gray area is the "how" and "when": 


CAT team tool.




Developer satisfaction




A way to start.


Fabric ((DevOps)) ??

Define a persona or pick a persona


Retention vs new users. (adoption vs satisfaction)




Decisions of priority and on getting the right things done. is on us.




Think how to keep Kim engaged in the execution review.


in the review meeting: we need to unify the story.
How do we get to improve our usage and NPS.


Backlog status items.


Epics + Features + (user stories?), tasks.




## Planning 

Themes == Pillars (use tags for it)


Epics: should be a deliverble
Significant delivery (big rock) 


Start your semester with planning what you want to announce next FabCon.


PM writes a feature:
- high level problem statement
- features need to complete ain a semister




Spec review.


Epic and feature name should be very clear (it shows in LT reports)



Add Aviv as optional

Provide value for our customers and raise the NPS.


(((( Kim is measured by usage and NPS ))))



It's not black and white picture.





Data engineers 
Data scientists 
RTI developers
PBI developers
 = are still our personas


We can put weights on the personas || or choose to focus on one for the coming two semesters.

# Fabric CLI Round Table


Alexander: Solution Archtect + Platform engineer
Switching from PaaS to SaaS.
CLI is number one tool.

- need to onboard team members


CLI code is also a documentaiton.
It's repeatable
keeps history of changes
fully accessible
can't be replaced by manual opetations.

lifecycle and change managment can be automated.


framework of error handling


OSS - can contribute to error handling



Can compare to Azure Shell
Most common scenario: fast forward some operations that would require many clicsk, if I know the shortcut. Will be a good powerboost. Many people are ui driven.
Creating an item in the workspace = 20 clicks. CLI = one command.

### PowerBI in CLI 
--- PowerBI API (add missing scopes)
--- rebind command (generic) / set?
--- Semantic model refresh ---> job run
--- Multiple export formats (can't be PBIX)
--- import + set (adhoc)



Blueprint --> code



-----------


Blueprint is not about deployment.

It's about the creation / declaring the intent: what this fabric project should do (archetecture, requreiment, components etc...)



it's not about the deployment.



The deployment is the consequence.





it's about creation not deployment.

it's about authoring.





You get more flexibility, withe one tool you can deploy, refresh, rebind etc... with one tool! you don't need to change the fabric CI/CD to do full orchestration of the deployment.







---







makes sure whatever it create is grounded in the spec.



If you already have a framweork.. then you'll start from the ide.. 





Today you start with the web.. and create everything there.. and then think about packaging and deployments...



Fabric pipeline.. still start from the browser..



unless they have a metadata driven framework..



---



Use AI to generate a CLI script from an existing solution..



Help you ** templatize ** .



I want to deploy it elsewhere in a very deterministic way.





(deploy it to another workspace --> why not pipelines).



---



# Blueprint + CLI 



even on the creation part it would make sense to create scripts, 



(it's not a deployment blueprint - you focus more on the what and less on the how).



Blueprint The level of details that helps you (or architect / project manager) envision the solution, before it's starting to build. you iterate on the blueprint.



it has two stages:

1) plan - iterating on the blueprint.

2) execution - start to create, 

CLI has very important role, in this step. We can have the agent to create the CLI script.



Rui use the blueprint-->CLI already in vscode.. 





A tool on top of the CLI.



"it exposes the entire service of Fabric".



---



** fabric-cicd into the CLI **

we need to support the same yaml files that users currently is using.





"Now the CLI is using the fabric-cicd.. you get more support". You don't need to install the cicd library.. 





--



We need to let the engineers and architects do it!





Read the article, teach an agent to use the CLI and you also get the code which you can reproduce/review etc...





UDF runtime?





Important: we need not to force the user to create the item, user can have the "option" to create the artifact.





Make sure notebook copilot understand the CLI! bring the fabric CLI to notebook.





scripting in notebooks: 

CLI python library (to wrap the run command)

What about error handling?  in the scripting.. 



We can have a python library/utility that you can import..

for example items: run_fab_command.

maybe have it as an example in the docs.. (the best way to handle the output and input etc...). If you want to call the CLI from python do this: "[]". We should maintain that utility!

Make it work with json format by default.



We can do the scripting with bash!! with %%sh

Would love to learn my process.

Change the content of the release notes items.
Think customer is reading this.


Breakdown the epic of remote MCP (based on the features).



We need to know which new items in the CLI are supported? 




Community contest - status.








Send josh and the team about the telemetry: downloads vs tool invocation.



Execution Tools for local MCP (decide)


private preveiw status


(( Post in reddit about cli set aliases ))



Schedule with Nimrod and Yaron on bulk import vs deploy and other stuff..
Also discuss git command.




CLI KrQ2 kickoff! (Alon)


Competition — check status

timeline of refresh semantic model onboarding to jobs? do we need to add custom support in the CLI.
Can we do it with the API (?)



CLI item
Tool that call CLI commands



Define as requirement
Write a spec for the abiltiy
Run remote CLI script
MCP tool to execute CLI code — talk with Mahir.


For MCP
For 

Discsuss with Tal, Yifat, Alon.


Tal: about the contest.

# with drew form sql db team

How the CLI team want other teams to contribute.



What is the options? sqldb options.



SQL DB...

They need the CLI to be comprehensive and to work.

Converge capabilities: you might have used AzCLI to create the dbs and then SQLpackage to deploy item defitionis to azure and then sqlcmd to run queries.

They also need the query!



Good insights about the CLI!!

it's not about the tools, it's what people are using it for, and whether or not this exists in the CLI. 



Could be true for datawarehouse as well.



In the past you'd use different tools.

# Agentic PM Work

## Put all the feedback in a db in Fabric
You must have a database with curated feedback. This needs to be querable.

injest notes manually
Needs tooling to aquire the feedback and classify it.




## Spec structure and writing + grounding based on feedback.

Generate click-trough as well.
(take Fabric UI from Teddy)

Enabling

Needs clarifying: on what are you expecting to happing.


CLI
GitHub Copilot CLI.
What are they trying to enable.

What's the story

What enables this experience: MCPs, 


Rayfen's job: is to introduce you into Fabric.


Personas:
- ProDev: who wants to build an app for their organizations.
- DevOps: 

JBTD > Persona.

What's Ops jobs, Dev jobs.


Bogdan says: their role is to enable capabilities for business users.
We do that for developers.

What information the LLM needs, 

I need to indicate what else I care about.



Cost optimization,

iterations,

"Dry-run mode for import" is vague.. i need to add some more info about each requirement?



Should work in git/ scenario 5.







Do I need to know what the batch import export is enough or I need the CI/CD.



Or I need to outline more detailed requirements





CLI commands





VS code extension dependency? 





Execution layer.

CLI today is an app, not a layer.

CLI SDK



Ran+Didi+Mahir+Yifaat - to discuss





Phase 1





CLI execution layer!

I need to explain WHY.

In local.. and also in remote.



Split into phase 1:
